### Limit user visibility and collaboration to specific projects

We're releasing a new preview feature that allows organization administrators to restrict users from collaborating outside of their project. This feature will bring another level of isolation and access control to projects. 

Users and groups added to the "**Project-Scoped Users**" group can only search for, view, select, and tag members who are also members of that same project.
