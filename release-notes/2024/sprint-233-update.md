# GitHub Integration - Improved AB# validation is generally available

We are excited to announce that improved AB# validation by the Azure Boards App in GithHub and Team Automation rules are both generally available! 

In Pipelines, we highlight the upcoming retirement of deprecated tasks. Update your pipelines to use a newer task version or an alternative before January 31, 2024. 

With this update, we also introduce support for custom CodeQL queries in Code scanning! This enables you to craft your own queries tailored to identify issues specific to your codebase.
