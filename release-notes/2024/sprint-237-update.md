# Enhancements and Integration Improvements in Azure Boards, Pipelines, and GitHub Advanced Security

We are excited to announce that we are closer to setting New Boards Hub as your default experience. It will introduce a refreshed design, improved performance, and better accessibility. Adding to Boards, we're previewing AB# Links on GitHub pull requests and a more reliable GitHub repository search, removing the risk of timeouts.

In Azure Pipelines, we're reinforcing our commitment to security with the introduction of a new "Edit queue build configuration" permission. This feature precisely regulates the setting of variables at queue time, including free-text runtime parameters, for a more secure pipeline environment.


For GitHub Advanced Security, we're stepping up our game by expanding our secret scanning capabilities. With a wider range of partner patterns now included, we're significantly enhancing the detection abilities of our Secret Scanning feature, providing a more secure environment for your projects.
