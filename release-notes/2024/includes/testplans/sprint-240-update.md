### Test and Feedback Extension in Manifest V3

We are excited to announce a new update to the Azure DevOps Test and Feedback extension! This update upgrades our implementation from manifest version 2 to version 3, in line with Google’s announcement about the deprecation schedule for Manifest V2. 

While the extension’s core features remain the same, this behind-the-scenes update enhances its security and performance. The updated extension will gradually roll out to both Chrome and Edge browsers in the coming weeks. We will monitor performance and feedback to ensure a smooth transition, and then expand the rollout based on the results. 

For more details, check out our recent blog post about this update. [Test & Feedback Extension in Manifest V3 - Azure DevOps Blog (microsoft.com)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/test-feedback-extension-v3/)
