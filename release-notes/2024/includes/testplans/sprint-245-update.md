### Seamless Build Pipeline Integration for Test Case Execution

We're excited to introduce a new feature that streamlines the test case execution process by seamlessly integrating build pipeline configurations. With this update, build definitions and IDs set at the test plan level will now automatically propagate to the Web Runner, eliminating the need for manual configuration each time you execute test cases. This enhancement not only saves your time but also improves overall testing efficiency, allowing testers to focus on more critical tasks. Check our new feature and ensure that all relevant build pipelines are readily available!

### Test and Feedback extension in Manifest V3 (Edge Release)

We’ve been gradually releasing this upgrade in Chrome, and now we’re expanding the rollout to Edge. 

This update transitions our implementation from Manifest Version 2 to Version 3, in line with Google's deprecation schedule for Manifest V2. While the core features of the extension remain unchanged, the update enhances both security and performance.

For more details, check out our recent blog post about this update. [Test & Feedback Extension in Manifest V3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/test-feedback-extension-v3/)
