### Markdown Copy Code to Clipboard Button

In response to your feedback in the  [developer community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/azure-devops-vsts-wiki-copy-code-button/421282), we’ve introduced a “Copy to Clipboard” button for all code blocks in rendered markdown. This enhancement is available across Wiki pages, markdown file previews in Repos, Pull Request discussions and descriptions, and Work Item discussions.
