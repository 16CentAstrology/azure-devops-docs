### Markdown Copy Code to Clipboard Button

Based on a [popular request](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/azure-devops-vsts-wiki-copy-code-button/421282) in developer community, we added a dedicated "Copy to Clipboard" button for code blocks in all rendered markdown, including Wiki, Repos markdown file previews, Pull Request discussions and descriptions, and Work Item discussions.
