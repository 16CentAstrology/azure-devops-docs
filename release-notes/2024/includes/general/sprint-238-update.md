### Wildcard as prefix search / substring search

Add wildcard to the beginning and to the end of a search term to look for all the strings, which contain your term across code, work items, wiki and packages. For example: if you type *test* in the search box, you'll get mytestclass, improvecodewithtest, and test_wikiarticle as search results. This feature is in the rollout phase and will be available to all customers during the next couple of weeks.
