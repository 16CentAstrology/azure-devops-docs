### Select a geography when creating a new Azure DevOps organization

When creating a new organization in Azure DevOps, you can now  select a geography, instead of a region. By default, the system selects your nearest geography, but you can opt for a different one based on your team's location or due to specific data sovereignty requirements. You can view your geography in the overview section of organization settings.
