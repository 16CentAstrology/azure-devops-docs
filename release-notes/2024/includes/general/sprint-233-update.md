### Azure DevOps OAuth self-service secret rotation

Every five years, itâ€™s essential to update the **Client Secret** for your Azure DevOps OAuth app, to ensure continuous generation of access and refresh tokens necessary for utilizing Azure DevOps APIs. As your **Client Secret** approaches expiration, you can now independently generate a new one, providing your team the freedom to manage it without relying on customer support. This flexibility in scheduling secret rotation minimizes potential outage time for your customers waiting for a replacement due to an expired secret.
