### Custom CodeQL Queries Now Supported in GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps 

We're thrilled to announce the introduction of support for custom CodeQL queries in Code scanning! This enables you to craft your own queries tailored to identify issues specific to your codebase. Now, you can create and publish packs containing custom queries, execute these queries in your pipelines, and customize the detection of vulnerabilities that are pertinent to your organization.

For more information on utilizing custom queries for code scanning in GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps, see to [Code scanning alerts for GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps](/azure/devops/repos/security/github-advanced-security-code-scanning?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true)

We value your input. If you have any questions or feedback, we encourage you to engage with our community at [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/home). 


### Azure Devops OAuth self-service secret rotation

Every five years, itâ€™s essential to update the **Client Secret** for your Azure DevOps OAuth app, to ensure continuous generation of access and refresh tokens necessary for utilizing Azure DevOps APIs. As your **Client Secret** approaches expiration, you can now independently generate a new one, providing your team the freedom to manage it without relying on customer support. This flexibility in scheduling secret rotation minimizes potential outage time for your customers waiting for a replacement due to an expired secret.
