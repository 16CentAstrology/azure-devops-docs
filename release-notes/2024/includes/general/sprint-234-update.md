### Linked Azure subscription required for GHAzDO enablement

If you previously enabled Advanced Security for repositories in an Azure DevOps organization without a linked Azure subscription, you may have noticed Advanced Security automatically disable itself on those repositories. To re-enable Advanced Security, add an associated Azure subscription to the organization. For more information on how to add or change your subscription, refer to [Change Azure subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/billing/change-azure-subscription?view=azure-devops).
