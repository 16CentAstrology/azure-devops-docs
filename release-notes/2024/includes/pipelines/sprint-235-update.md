### Rerun a single stage

One way to do a rollback in YAML pipelines is to rerun a stage from a previous, successful pipeline run. 

Starting with this sprint, you can rerun a single stage, and skip rerunning its dependent stages. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of rerun this stage.](../../media/235-pipelines-01.png "Screenshot of rerun this stage")

If a stage You can still rerun a stage _and_ its dependent stages (if any), like before.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of rerun stage and dependents.](../../media/235-pipelines-02.png "Screenshot of rerun stage and dependents")
