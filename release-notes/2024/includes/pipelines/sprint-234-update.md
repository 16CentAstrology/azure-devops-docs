### Validate and Save by default when editing YAML pipelines


An incorrect YAML pipeline can lead to wasted time and effort. To improve your pipeline editing productivity, we are changing the _Save_ button in the editor to also do YAML validation. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of  new button.](../../media/234-pipelines-05.png "Screenshot of new button")

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of validate and save.](../../media/234-pipelines-06.png "Screenshot of validate and save")

If your pipeline has errors, you'll still be able to save it.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of pipeline is valid.](../../media/234-pipelines-07.png "Screenshot of save anyway")

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of errors detected.](../../media/234-pipelines-08.png "Screenshot of errors detected")


We also improved the _Validate_ experience, so you can see the errors in a list thats easier to understand.
