### New REST API Limit on Work Item Comments

As a security improvement, weâ€™ve introduced a new limit on the number of comments that can be added to work items via the REST API. Now, each work item can have a maximum of one thousand comments when added through the API. This limit applies exclusively to the REST API; users accessing the web interface can continue to add comments manually, even if the total exceeds one thousand.
