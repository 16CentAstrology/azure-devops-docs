### Show GitHub pull request details (preview)

In the current integration, when a link is added to a GitHub pull request, we only present the open and closed status of that pull request on the work item. Recognizing there are more activities that unfold between these states the new experience is designed to present more information.  You can easily discern if the pull request is in draft mode, requires a review, or is undergoing status checks. All without the need to open the pull request directly.
