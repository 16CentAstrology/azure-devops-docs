###  New Boards Hub on by default

If you’ve been keeping up with the progress of New Boards Hub, you’re probably aware that the preview has been active for quite some time now. In fact, we officially [announced the preview](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/new-boards-hub-public-preview/) of New Boards Hub almost two years ago to the day.

Today, we’re thrilled to announce the final stage of our journey. We are beginning the process of making New Boards Hub the default experience for all of our customers. This will happen in two waves, with the first wave kicking off in the first week of April. The rollout process for each wave will span several weeks, as we gradually roll out to a different set of customers every other day. The second (final) wave will most likely start sometime in late May.

For more information, please see our [latest blog post here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/new-boards-hub-on-as-default/).

###  Link to work item to the development section of the GitHub pull 



###  Add link to GitHub commit or pull request (general availability)

After several weeks [in preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/release-notes/2024/sprint-234-update#azure-boards-1), we are excited to announce an enhanced experience by enabling search functionality when linking to a GitHub pull request or commit. Search and select the desired repository and drill down to find and link to the specific pull request or commit. No more need for multiple window changes and copy/paste (although you still have that option).

This feature is only available in the [New Boards Hub preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/release-notes/2022/sprint-202-update#new-boards-hubs-now-available-in-public-preview).

###  Connect to GitHub repository search improvements (private preview)

For GitHub organizations housing thousands of repositories, [connecting them](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/boards/github/connect-to-github?view=azure-devops) to an Azure DevOps project has posed significant challenges. Previously, attempts to connect encountered timeout issues, preventing you from integrating GitHub with Azure Boards. Today we are announcing a preview that will unblock large GitHub organizations. You will now be able to search and select across thousands of repositories without the risk of timeout issues.

We are happy to enable to this feature upon request. If you are interested, please [send us](mailto:dahellem@microsoft.com) your Azure DevOps organization name (dev.azure.com/{organization}).
