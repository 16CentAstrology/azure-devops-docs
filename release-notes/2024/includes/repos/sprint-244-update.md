## UI support of Git Submodules

Many teams actively use Git Submodules to organize their codebase. We're excited to share that we've added support of Git Submodules in the Files hub: now you can instantly navigate to a submodule repository with just a single click, exactly to the specific commit referenced from your superproject. When used as a submodule, the following Git services are supported: Azure Repos, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket. Multiple URL formats specified in .gitmodules file are supported, including absolute HTTPS, SSH, and relative URLs.

This addresses a feature request from Developer Community: [[Azure DevOps Repos] Git submodule preview in UI](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/azure-devops-repos-git-submodule-preview-in-ui/1033995)
