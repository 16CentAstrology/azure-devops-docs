###  New "Health and usage" panel in repo file hub 

As your Git repositories grow over time, they can accumulate a large number of commits, blobs, and other data. Frequent Git operations on these repositories, especially as they increase in size, can place additional load on Azure DevOps infrastructure, potentially affecting performance and user experience.

Ensuring the health of your repository is essential for maintaining optimal performance and reliability. To support this, we now monitor several factors that influence repository health, including size, commit frequency, contents, and structure. If your repository begins to significantly impact infrastructure, you may receive a notification from our support team with recommendations for corrective action. By managing your repository’s size and health, you can help avoid disruptions and maintain smooth operations.

To check the health of your repository, navigate to the Azure Repos Git repo, select Repo > Files, and choose “Health and usage” from the ellipsis menu to open the Repository health and usage panel.
