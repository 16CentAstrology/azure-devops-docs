### Code Coverage results for folders

The results for the code coverage are now available for every individual file and folder rather than only as a top-level number. The code coverage view is by default in the ***Folder view mode***. In that mode you can drill down and see the code coverage for that selected subtree. Use the toggle button to switch between the new and old views.
