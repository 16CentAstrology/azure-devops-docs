### Code Coverage results for folders

We've enhanced the tasks publishing the code coverage results. The results for the code coverage are now available for every individual file and folder rather than only as a top-level number. The code coverage view is by default in the ***Folder view mode***. In that mode you can drill down and see the code coverage for that selected subtree. The below image shows how that is displayed.

The screenshot displays the code coverage details at the Folder / File level. As outlined in the screenshot use the toggle button to switch between the new and old views.
