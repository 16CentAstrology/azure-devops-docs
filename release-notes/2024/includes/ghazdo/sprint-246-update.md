### Pull request annotations for dependency and code scanning

As indicated in the Advanced Security roadmap item, [Pull-request annotations](/azure/devops/release-notes/roadmap/2024/ghazdo/pull-request-annotation), you will now receive in-line annotations on any pull requests that utilize a pipeline assigned to your build validation policy with dependency scanning and/or code scanning tasks included.

There is no opt-in needed aside from creating a build validation policy to be applied against select branches.

Clicking on `Show more details` in the annotation will bring you to the alert detail view for the alert in question.
