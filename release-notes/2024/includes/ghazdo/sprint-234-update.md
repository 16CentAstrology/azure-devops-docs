### Linked Azure subscription required for GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps enablement

If you previously enabled Advanced Security for repositories in an Azure DevOps organization without a linked Azure subscription, you may have noticed Advanced Security automatically disable itself on those repositories. To re-enable Advanced Security, add an associated Azure subscription to the organization. For more information on how to add or change your subscription, see [Change Azure subscription](/azure/devops/organizations/billing/change-azure-subscription?view=azure-devopsthe&preserve-view=true).
