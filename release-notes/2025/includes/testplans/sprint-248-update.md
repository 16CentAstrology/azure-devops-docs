### Direct Link from Test Plan Work Item to Test Plans Page

We’ve made it easier to access the Test Plans page directly from the Test Plans work item. Previously, customers reported difficulty locating the corresponding test plan page when navigating from the work item. We heard your feedback, and we hope this improvement, by adding a clear entry point, enhances traceability and eases navigation issues.

If you have any feedback or encounter issues, please let us know!

### Auto Pause for Test Case Execution preview

Manual testers often face the frustrating experience of losing partial test run data when they forget to mark an incomplete test case as "Paused" before hitting "Save and Close." This oversight can mean losing all progress on a complex or long-running test case and having to start from scratch. To address this pain point, we're introducing **Auto Pause for Test Case Run**. This new feature automatically marks a test case as "Paused" if the tester steps away or interrupts their work, ensuring data is saved without needing a manual pause. By simplifying the pause and resume process, we’re making it easier to pick up exactly where you left off. A private preview will begin in the coming weeks—please [email us](mailto:adocustomerfeedback@service.microsoft.com) if you’d like to join!
