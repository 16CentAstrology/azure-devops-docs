### Test Plans bug fixes

We’ve made updates to Test Plans, resolving several bugs and improving usability. Here’s what’s been fixed:

* **Shared Step Results Now Visible:**
    Fixed a bug where shared step results wouldn’t appear in the query editor when accessing test cases in the New Boards Hub.

* **Improved Stakeholder Mode Sessions:**
    Resolved an error that caused issues when starting sessions in TFE Stakeholder mode, ensuring smooth collaboration.
* **Cleaner Test Plan Copying:**
    Fixed a problem where requirements were duplicated when copying a Test Plan using the “Reference Existing Test Cases” option.
