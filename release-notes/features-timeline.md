## Product roadmap

This feature list is a peek into our roadmap. It identifies some of the significant features we are currently working on and a rough timeframe for when you can expect to see them. It is not comprehensive but is intended to provide some visibility into key investments. 

Each feature is linked to an article where you can learn more about a particular item. These features and dates are the current plans at this time and are subject to change. The year and quarter tabs reflect when the feature will be available on Azure DevOps Services.
