### Azure DevOps now allows team admins to create subscriptions from MS Teams & Slack

In addition to Project administrators, Azure DevOps now allows Team admin(s) to create subscriptions for Azure Boards, Azure Repos, and Azure Pipelines directly from Slack and MS Teams.


### MS Teams & Slack notifications for Repos events

As enhancement to our MS Teams and Slack integration you now can choose to subscribe to one or more events on a pull request such as comments, code push, updates, and attempt merges.
