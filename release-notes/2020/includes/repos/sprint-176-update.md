### Org-level setting for default branch

There is now an organization-level setting for your preferred initial branch name for new repositories. If a project has not chosen an initial branch name, then this org-level setting will be used. If you did not specify the initial branch name in the org settings or the project settings, then new repositories will use an Azure DevOps defined default.
