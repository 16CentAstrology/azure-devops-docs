### Improved PR actionability

When you have a large number of pull requests to review, understanding where you should take action first can be difficult. To improve pull request actionability, you can now create multiple custom queries on the PR list page with several new options to filter by such as draft state. These queries will create separate and collapsible sections on your PR page in addition to "Created by me" and "Assigned to me". You can also decline to review a pull request that you were added to via the Vote menu or the context menu on the PR list page. In the custom sections, you will now see separate tabs for pull requests that you have provided a review on or declined to review. These custom queries will work across repositories on the "My pull requests" tab of the organization home page. If you want to come back to a pull request, you can flag it and they will show up at the top of your list. Lastly, pull requests that have been set to auto-complete will be marked with a pill that says 'Auto-complete' in the list.

### Improved comment-related filtering within pull requests 

Pull request filtering can help you review them faster so we have added some more requested filters to the pull request details page: 

- Comment status: Active (default), or All, Pending, Resolved, As designed, Won't fix, Closed.
- Commented by: Filter to comments left by a specific person.
- File types: Show all files (default), or show only the files that have been commented on.
