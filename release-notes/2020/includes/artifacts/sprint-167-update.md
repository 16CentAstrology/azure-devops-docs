### NPM performance improvements

<div><p style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="color:black;">We have made changes to our core
design to improve the way we store and deliver NPM packages in Azure Artifacts

of the highest used APIs for NPM.</span></p></div>
