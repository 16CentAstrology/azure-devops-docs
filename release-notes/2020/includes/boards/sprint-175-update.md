### Allow stakeholders to move work items across board columns - GA

Stakeholders now have the ability move work items across board columns on both the Kanban and Task boards.

    
### Editing description (help text) on system fields

You have always been able to edit the description of custom fields. But for system fields like priority, severity, and activity, the description was not editable. This was a feature gap between the Hosted XML and Inherited and was preventing some customers from migrating to the Inherited model. In sprint 175, we now allow you to edit the description on system fields. The edited value will only affect that field in the process and for that work item type. This gives you the flexibility to have different descriptions for the same field on different work item types.
