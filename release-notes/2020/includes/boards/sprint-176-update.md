### Customize work item state when pull request is merged

A few sprints back, we released this feature under private preview. After taking feedback and fixing bugs, it is now generally available on all organizations. See the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/notifications/add-links-to-work-items?view=azure-devops#set-work-item-state-in-pull-request">documentation for details</a> on how to set the state of work items when completing a pull request.

### Parent field on the task board

Due to popular request, you can now add the Parent field to both the child and parent cards on the Task Board.
