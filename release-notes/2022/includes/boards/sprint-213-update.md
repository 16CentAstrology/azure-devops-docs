### Copy comment links

Using the new **Copy link** action, you can copy a link to a specific work item comment. Paste that link into another work item comment or description. When clicked on, the work item will be opened, and the comment is highlighted.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Gif to demo copy comments link.](../../media/213-boards-01.gif "gif to demo copy comments link")

See [community suggestion ticket](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/link-to-a-discusion-comment-in-another-work-item/529118).
