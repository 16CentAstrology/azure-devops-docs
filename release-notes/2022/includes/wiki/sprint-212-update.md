### Improved support for Mermaid diagrams

On Wiki we're now supporting the following Mermaid diagram types:

* Flow Chart
* Class Diagram
* State Diagram
* User Journey
* Pie Chart
* Requirements Diagrams
* Sequence Diagram
* Gantt Diagram
* Git Graph

In addition, we've added support for the two experimental (not officially supported) diagrams:

* ER Diagrams
* C4 Diagrams

The experimental diagram types can be used only when a flag allowing to use them is switched on (speak with customer support).
