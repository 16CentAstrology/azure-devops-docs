### Improvements to strengthen security in Azure DevOps

Azure DevOps will now respond to upstream security events in Azure AD (e.g., password changes) faster. As a result users may be asked to re-authenticate after a security event to continue using the service. For web flows, users may be prompted to re-authenticate and have to fulfil the required conditional access policies (e.g., Multi-factor auth, IP fencing etc.) as mandated by their company administrators.
