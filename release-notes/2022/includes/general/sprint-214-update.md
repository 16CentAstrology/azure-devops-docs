### Extensions should display their Scopes 

When admins install extensions to their Azure DevOps organization, they can review the permissions the extension needs as part of the installation. However, once they are installed, the extension permissions are not visible in the extension settings. This has posed a problem to administrators when they need to perform a periodic review of installed extensions. In this sprint, we have added the extension permissions to extension settings to help administrators review and take an informed decision on whether to keep them or not.
