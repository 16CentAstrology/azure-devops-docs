### Preview the new Test Plan page 

Most of the authoring and execution capabilities offered under Test Plans are now available in the new Test Plans* page. You can perform bulk edit operation on the test cases using grid and list view. Column customization is also available to help you see the data according to your preference. We have decreased the font of the text to accumulate titles of large text size. You can reorder test suite in the test suite tree and test cases within the test suite.

With the above features, the Test Plans* page is enriched with all the key authoring and execution features and is available as a default page under Azure Test Plans. If you see any gaps in the new page, you can move back to the old page by switching off the feature flag. While doing so, please provide us the feedback at newtestplanpage@microsoft.com which will help us improve better.
