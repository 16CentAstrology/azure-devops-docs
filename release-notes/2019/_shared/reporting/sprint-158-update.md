### Inline sprint burndown using story points

Based on the feedback you provided in the [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/idea/365784/sprint-burndown-using-story-points-effort.html), we've updated the sprint **Burndown Trend** report under the sprints **Analytics** tab to burndown using story points.

To configure the report, select the backlog level or the work item type and the metric to burndown on. Your selections will be saved for this sprint and team.
