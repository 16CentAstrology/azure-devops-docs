# Bulk Dashboard Deletion

The Bulk Azure DevOps Dashboard Deletion feature is a major enhancement to dashboard lifecycle management, providing a streamlined process that allows organizations and teams to efficiently handle the bulk removal of dashboards. This is particularly beneficial for those close to reaching their dashboard limits. This tool greatly simplifies the clean-up phase in the dashboard lifecycle, offering a straightforward way to select and delete multiple dashboards directly from the dashboard directory. Moreover, a soft-delete function will be introduced to safeguard against accidental data loss, retaining dashboards for 28 days before permanent deletion. This feature is a vital addition to efficient dashboard lifecycle management, ensuring that dashboard organization and maintenance are manageable and secure, which in turn improves overall operational efficiency.
