# Support YAML stage status on Deployment control in work item form with GitHub repository

Similar to how classic release pipelines report deployment status, extend support for YAML pipelines to display stage status on the **Deployments** control within the work item form when your code resides in a GitHub repository.

Depends on [Show build status when using a YAML build pipeline with GitHub repository](boards-yaml-pipeline-show-build-status.md).
