# Dashboard Archive

The new Dashboard Archive feature is designed to address the critical need for data preservation in dashboard organization and in-house cleanup. As customers face challenges in coordinating across teams to manage the ever-growing list of dashboards, this feature introduces a reliable safety net to prevent irreversible data loss. Users now have the ability to archive multiple dashboards, ensuring that any deletions—intentional or accidental—do not result in a permanent loss of data. Alongside this archiving capability, a restoration option is readily available, allowing for the seamless retrieval of archived dashboards. Looking ahead, the Dashboard Archive ensures the safeguarding of dashboard data integrity over the long term.
