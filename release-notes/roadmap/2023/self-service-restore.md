# Restore deleted test plans and test suites using REST API

Currently, we don't have a mechanism to restore accidentally deleted test plans or test suites. To get these restored, you can create a support ticket and our internal teams manually restore these artifacts on your behalf. We are changing this by letting you deleted test plans and test suites through our REST API.
