# Recycle bin improvements

As a user with permanently delete work item permissions, I need to be able to:

- Search and find specific work items that have been deleted
- Select all work items in the recycle bin and permanently delete them
- Recycle bin actions and response times need to be fast

> [!NOTE]
> This feature has been cut. The original intention was to re-do how the recycle bin works within New Boards Hub because of performance issues at scale. However, were able to successfully solve these issues without making significant changes. We will review the status of the recycle bin once New Boards Hub is out of preview.
