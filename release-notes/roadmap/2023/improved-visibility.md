# Improved co-relation between test run and test case versions

We're improving the co-relation experience between test results and the version of test case definition used to execute that particular run. We're also reducing the number of steps & clicks it takes to view the test case definition of a run. Test run is an important pillar of Azure Test Plans and these improvements will address long-standing user needs around post execution analysis.
