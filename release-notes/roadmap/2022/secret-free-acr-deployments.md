# Workload identity federation for Docker service connection

Workload Identity federation for Azure service connection was [announced in public preview](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/public-preview-of-workload-identity-federation-for-azure-pipelines/) in September 2023. After this has become [generally available](/azure/devops/release-notes/roadmap/2022/secret-free-azurerm-deployments), we will update the Docker service connection to support Workload identity federation when accessing Azure Container Registry.
