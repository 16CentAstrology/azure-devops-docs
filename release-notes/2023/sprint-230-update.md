# TBD

With this update, we are announcing the upcoming deprecation of NuGet Restore v1 and NuGet Installer v0 pipeline tasks. Promptly transition to the NuGetCommand@2 pipeline task to avoid build failure starting on November 27, 2023. 

In Azure Pipelines, we also introduce security improvements for the process of building pull requests from forked GitHub repositories.

Check out the release notes for details.
