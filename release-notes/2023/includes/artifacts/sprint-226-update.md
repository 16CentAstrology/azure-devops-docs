### Introducing Azure Artifacts support for Cargo Crates 

We are excited to announce that Azure Artifacts natively supports Cargo crates.
This support includes feature parity with respect to our existing protocols, in addition to crates.io being available as an upstream source. Rust developers and teams can now consume, publish, manage, and share their Cargo crates seamlessly, all while leveraging Azure's robust infrastructure and staying in the familiar Azure DevOps environment.
