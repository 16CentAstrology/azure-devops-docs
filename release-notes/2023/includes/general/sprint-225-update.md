### Granular delegated scopes for Microsoft Identity/Azure AD OAuth apps

We have added new [Azure DevOps scopes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/oauth?view=azure-devops#scopes)  for delegated OAuth apps on the Microsoft Identity platform, also colloquially known as [Azure Active Directory OAuth apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/oauth?view=azure-devops#azure-ad-oauth). These new scopes will enable app developers to announce specifically which permissions they are hoping to request from the user in order to perform app duties. Learn more about this new release in our [blog post](link to come).
