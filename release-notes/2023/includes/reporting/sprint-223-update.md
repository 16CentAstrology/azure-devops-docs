### Introducing "Resolved as Completed" in Burn-down and Burn-up Charts

We understand the importance of accurately reflecting team progress, including Resolved items as completed in the charts. With a simple toggle option, you can now choose to display Resolved items as completed, providing a true reflection of the team's burn-down state. This enhancement allows for more accurate tracking and planning, empowering teams to make informed decisions based on actual progress. Experience improved transparency and better insights with the updated Burn-down and Burn-up charts in ADO Reporting.
