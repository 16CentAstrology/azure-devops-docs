### Search and filter stages in the Pipelines stages side panel

The ability to have the pull request widget include multiple repos has been a [long-time request](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/allow-multiple-repository-selection-in-pull-reques/982784) from our users. This sprint we are happy to announce a private preview of the new widget.

### Interactive Boards Reports

These interactive reports, located in the Boards hub, have been accessible as a preview feature for several years now. They replace the older Cumulative Flow Diagram, Velocity, and Sprint Burndown charts. In this sprint we are taking them out of preview and officially making them generally available


To view these charts, click the Analytics tab location on the Kanban Board, Backlog, and Sprints pages.
