### Pull request widget for multiple repos (preview)

The ability to have the pull request widget include multiple repos has been a [long-time request](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/allow-multiple-repository-selection-in-pull-reques/982784) in the developer community. This sprint we are happy to announce a private preview of the new widget.
