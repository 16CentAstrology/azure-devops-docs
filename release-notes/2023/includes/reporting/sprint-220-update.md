### Analytics Views are now generally available

The Analytics Views feature has been in preview for an extended period of time. Today we are happy to announce that this feature is now generally available to all organizations. 

An Analytics view provides a simplified way to specify the filter criteria for a Power BI report based on Analytics data.
