# TBD

We are excited to announce that [GitHub Advanced Security](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/now-generally-available-github-advanced-security-for-azure-devops-is-ready-for-you-to-use/) and Managed identity and service principal support for Azure DevOps are now generally available!

On GitHub Advanced Security, we've also improved code scanning to include all user-provided inputs in the CodeQL Initialize task. In addition, we expanded CodeQL support to include Swift. 

In Boards, we are releasing Team Automation Rules in private preview. Now, you can configure each backlog level to automate the opening and closing/resolving of work items based on the state(s) of their children. Check out the release notes if you are interested in enrolling in the private preview.
