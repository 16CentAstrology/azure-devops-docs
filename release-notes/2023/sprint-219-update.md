# Improved dashboard management and pipeline security 
With this update, we have added the capability to track when a dashboard was last viewed or modified. This improvement will help project administrators evaluate if a dashboard needs to be removed due to inactivity, further preventing reaching stored dashboard thresholds.  

We also continue our investments in security. Now, OAuth2 is the default authentication mechanism when creating a GitHub Enterprise Server hosted pipeline.  

Check out the release notes for details.
