# Functional code search  

[!INCLUDE [version-header](../../includes/version-tfs-2017-through-vsts.md)]

By using Code Search, you can do the following tasks and more.


|**Search task**  |**Description** |
|---------|---------|
|**[Search across all of your projects](#functions-to-select-projects-repositories-paths-and-files)**  | Search in your own code base and your partner teams' code bases. Use cross-project searches over all the code in your Azure DevOps instance to search across your entire codebase. Narrow your search by using project, repository, path, file name, and other filter operators.        |
|**[Find specific types of code](#functions-to-find-specific-types-of-code)**  |  Find definitions, references, functions, comments, strings, and namespaces. Use Code Search to narrow your results to exact code type matches. Go quickly to a method definition to understand its implementation. Apply the definition filter or scope the search to references to view calls and maximize code reuse.       |
|**[Easily drill down or widen your search](#find-related-items-or-other-terms)**   | When you find an item of interest, place the cursor on it and use the shortcut menu to quickly search for that text across all your projects and files. Easily trace how your code works by using the shortcut menu to search for related items such as definitions and references - directly from inside a file.        |

## Prerequisites

To use Code Search, you must have at least a **Basic** access. **Stakeholders** don't have access to code, and so don't have access to Code Search. 

## Get started searching code

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
  
To start your search, choose **Repos** > **Files** or another page under **Code**. Enter a keyword or phrase in the search box, and then select *Enter* or choose :::image type="icon" source="../search/media/shared/start-search-icon.png" border="false"::: start search. 

:::image type="content" source="../../organizations/public/media/search/code-search-vert.png" alt-text="Code Search box":::
 
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=" <= tfs-2018"

Code Search requires the [Code Search extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-code-search). If it isn't installed, request that a member of your Project Collection Administrators group [install it](../..//marketplace/install-extension.md).  

1. In the search box, check that the text displays _Search code_. If it doesn't, select it.

   :::image type="content" source="media/code-search-get-started/title-bar-search-box-empty-outlined.png" alt-text="Switch between searching for code and work items":::

2. Enter a search string in the text box, and then select _Enter_ or  
   ![start search action icon](../search/media/shared/start-search-icon.png) start search.

### Code search best practices

- Achieve your wanted results even faster by starting with a higher-level search. You can narrow your search by using project, repository, path, file name, and other filter operators. 
- Ensure that you get to the results you desire even when you're not sure of the exact term you're looking for. [Use wildcards to widen your search](get-started-search.md#code-1) and [Boolean operators to fine-tune it](get-started-search.md#code). 
- Find more information about an item of interest faster and with minimal efforts. When you find an item of interest, place the cursor on it and use the shortcut menu to quickly search for that text across all your projects and files.
- Easily trace how your code works by using the shortcut menu to search for related items such as definitions and references â€“ directly from inside a file or from the search results.
- Go quickly to the implementation of, for example, an API your code might be taking dependency on by narrowing down your results to exact code type matches. Use code type filters to search for specific kinds of code such as definitions, references, functions, comments, strings, namespaces, and more. 

## Syntax for simple and compound searches

- Use simple search strings for words or phrases. The default is a whole word search; for example, a search for "valid" won't find instances of the word "validation".
- Wrap each word in double-quotes to treat them as separate search terms.
- Separate words with spaces (not wrapped), so Search assumes the `AND` operator between the words.
- Escape the special characters, `(`,  `)`, `[`, `]`, `:`, `*`, and `?`, by enclosing them in a phrase delimited with double-quotes like `"` and `"`.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't search code in forked repositories. 
### Search Git projects and repositories

In a Git project, you see a list of the repositories that it contains. Use the project and repository checkboxes to widen your search. You can search more or all projects, or narrow your search to fewer projects and repositories. If there are more than a few projects or repositories, use the **Show more** link to see them all.

Code Search can index multiple branches in a Git repository. By default it indexes files in only the default branch of your Git repositories. Your default branch is usually the **main** branch. Specify the branches for each repository, indexing in the **Options** tab of the **Repositories** section, [project settings page](../navigation/go-to-service-page.md#open-project-settings).

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
![Configure Git branches to include in search](media/advanced-work-item-search-syntax/configure-branches.png)
::: moniker-end

In a TFVC project, you see a list of folder paths in that project for which you have read access - you won't see any projects and folders for which you don't have read permission. Select paths in the folder tree to narrow your search if necessary.

> [!TIP]
> Code Search remembers your last settings, such as the project and repository or path that you searched in. Clear the checkboxes to search across all projects easily with the **Clear all** links when you want to search in a different scope. In the results pane, Code Search highlights up to the first 100 hits or matches found in the target files.

## Functions to find specific types of code

As you type in the search box, select functions and keywords from the drop-down list to quickly create your query. Use the **Show more** link to display all the available functions and keywords. Mix and match the functions as required.

You can also select one or a combination of filters from the list in the left column. Again, the **Show more** link displays all the available functions and keywords.

Instead, you can type the functions and parameters directly into the search box. The following table shows the full list of functions for selecting specific types or members in your C#, C, C++, Java, and Visual Basic.NET code.

## Functions to select projects, repositories, paths, and files

Functions make it easy to narrow the search to specified locations, specific types of files within these locations, or specified filenames. Mix and match the functions as required.

Narrow the search to a specific location using the `proj`, `repo`, or `path` filters:


|**Usage**  |**Example**  |
|---------|---------|
|Finds all occurrences of the word **QueueJobsNow** in the **Fabrikam** project.     | `QueueJobsNow proj:Fabrikam`        |
|Finds all occurrences of the word **QueueJobsNow** in the **Contoso** repository.    |  `QueueJobsNow repo:Contoso`       |
|Finds all occurrences of the word **QueueJobsNow** in the path **VisualStudio/Services/Framework** and its subpaths.  | `QueueJobsNow path:VisualStudio/Services/Framework`        |
|Enclose the argument to the filter in double-quotes if it contains a space.   | `QueueJobsNow path:"VisualStudio/Windows Phones and Devices/Services"`        |
|Finds all occurrences of the word **QueueJobsNow** in all files where the filename starts with **queueRegister**. | `QueueJobsNow file:queueRegister*`         |
|Finds all files with the name QueueRegister without an extension.    | Use quotes to find files without extensions: file:"queueRegister"       |
|Finds all occurrences of the word **QueueJobsNow** in only C# source files. A plain text search string that doesn't include file type functions will also find files where the string matches part of the filename.  |  `QueueJobsNow ext:cs`       |


## Find related items or other terms
   
One of the powerful features of Code Search is the capability to expand your search interactively, based on the results of previous searches. For example, you can easily broaden your search to related files when tracing or debugging code. 

Place the insertion point on a term in the file and open the shortcut menu (mouse: right-click) to start a new search for other files containing the selected term. You can search for it as text, for 
the definition if you select an object name, or for references to a selected object. 

For more information about the following search functions, see [Get started with Search](get-started-search.md#semantic-search-features).
- Keyword
- Exact match
- Wildcard
- Wildcard in combination
- Boolean operators
- Proximity
- Special characters

## More examples of code search functions

See the following examples of even more code search functions. You can use the code type search functions with files written in C#, C, C++, Java, and Visual Basic.NET. Open the search results in a new browser tab from either search box and select _Ctrl_ + _Enter_. In Google Chrome, select _Ctrl_ + _Shift_ + _Enter_ to switch the focus to the new browser tab. 


|**Usage** |**Example** |
|---------|---------|
|Find all instances of "ToDo" comments in your code               |Select `comment:` and type `todo`   |
|Search in specific locations, such as within a particular path   |Use a search string such as `Driver path:MyShuttle/Server`    | 
|Search for files by name or just by file extension    | For example, you could use `Driver file:GreenCabs.cs`. The search string `error ext:resx` could be useful if you want to review all error strings in your code. Even if your plain text search string matches part of a filename, the file appears in the list of found files. This search works without matching specific file type functions.        |
|Combine two or more words by using Boolean operators   | `validate OR release`        |
|Find an exact match to a set of words by enclosing your search terms in double-quotes.|`"Client not found"`|

## Search Code with REST API

You can use APIs to extend or supplement the capabilities listed in this article. For information about Code Search with REST API, see [Fetch Code Search Results](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/azure/devops/search/code%20search%20results/fetch%20code%20search%20results?preserve-view-not-set).
