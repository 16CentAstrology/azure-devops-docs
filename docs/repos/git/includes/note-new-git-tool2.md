Visual Studio 2019 version 16.8 and later versions provides a Git version control experience while maintaining the **Team Explorer** Git user interface. You can exercise Git features from either interface interchangeably. Below, we provide a side-by-side comparison for cloning a repository.

> [!NOTE]
> One advantage of connecting to a project through **Team Explorer** is you gain access to the Work Items hub. For an overview of **Team Explorer** features, see [Navigate in Visual Studio Team Explorer](../../../user-guide/work-team-explorer.md).
