# Universal Packages upstream source

With Azure Artifacts, you can enable upstream sources to start consuming packages from public registries such as NuGet.org or npmjs.com. Once you enable upstream sources, Azure Artifacts will save a copy of any packages you install from upstream. Azure Artifacts also supports using other feeds as upstreams. In this article, you will learn how to add a new Universal Packages upstream source with a feed in your organization or other organizations within the same Azure Active Directory. See [Manage access with Azure Active Directory](../../organizations/accounts/connect-organization-to-azure-ad.md) to learn how to connect your organization to Azure Active Directory.
