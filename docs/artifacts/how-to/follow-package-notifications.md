# Package notification

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2017](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2017.md)]

Notifications are a great tool to stay informed about specific changes within your project. In Azure Artifacts, when you follow a package youâ€™ll be notified every time a new version of that package is published. A notification will be sent to your preferred email address with details about the new published version. The preferred email address is usually the email address you signed into Azure DevOps with, but you can change it from your profile page.

## Follow a package

1. Select **Artifacts**, and then select your feed.

1. Select the package you want to follow.

1. Select **Follow** to start getting notified whenever a new version is published.

## Views notifications

Aside from getting notifications when a new package version is published, you can also set up alerts to be notified when a package is promoted to a view. This can be helpful to filter alerts and only receive specific notifications especially in a busy development cycle when numerous packages are being published.

1. Select **Artifacts**, and then select your feed.

1. Filter to a specific view (for example, @Prerelease, @Release)

## Follow a package with personal notifications

 In addition to following a package from the _Feeds_ page, you can also [manage your personal notifications](../../notifications/manage-your-personal-notifications.md) and set up alerts to be notified about a specific package or set of packages from the _Notification Settings_ page.
