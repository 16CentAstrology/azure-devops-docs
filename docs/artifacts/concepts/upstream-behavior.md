# Configure upstream behavior

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

With Azure Artifacts upstream sources, developers gain the convenience of utilizing a unified feed to both publish and consume packages from Artifact feeds and popular public registries like NuGet.org or npmjs.com. Previously, Artifact feeds combined a list of available package versions from both the feed itself and all the configured upstream sources.

Upstream behavior is a feature that enables developers to choose if they want to consume externally sourced package versions. It governs which packages are accessible from the public registries for specific packages.

Once upstream behavior is enabled, when a package is published to your Azure Artifacts feed, any version from the public registry will be blocked and not made available for download.

This approach adds an extra layer of security by preventing potential exposure to malicious packages that might have infiltrated the public registries.

However, users still have the option to deactivate the upstream behavior setting, allowing them to consume packages from the public registries if they prefer to do so.

> [!NOTE]
> The new behavior will not impact any package versions that are currently in use, as they are preserved within the feed's *@local* view.

## Applicable scenarios

The following section illustrates various common scenarios where the upstream behavior is triggered to block externally sourced package versions, and other scenarios where there's no need to block access to public packages.

### Public versions are blocked

* [Private package version made public](#private-package-version-made-public)
* [Having both private and public packages](#having-both-private-and-public-packages)

#### Private package version made public

In this scenario, a team has a private package that was made public. The upstream behavior in this case will be triggered to block any new public versions (untrusted packages).

#### Having both private and public packages 

In this scenario, if a team uses a combination of private and public packages, enabling the upstream behavior blocks any new package versions from the public registry.

:::image type="content" source="media\private-and-public-packages.svg" alt-text="An illustration showing available private and public packages.":::

### Public versions won't be blocked

* [All packages are private](#all-packages-are-private)
* [All packages are public](#all-packages-are-public)
* [Public package made private](#public-package-made-private)

#### All packages are private*

If all existing packages are private, and the team has no plans to use any public packages, the new upstream behavior will have no effect on the team's workflow in this scenario.

:::image type="content" source="media\only-private-packages.svg" alt-text="An illustration showing feed with only private packages.":::

#### All packages are public

In this scenario, if the team exclusively consumes public packages, whether from the public registry or other open-source repositories, the new upstream behavior won't impact their workflow in any way.

:::image type="content" source="media\public-packages-only.svg" alt-text="An illustration showing feed with only public packages.":::

#### Public package made private

In this situation, when a public package is converted to a private package, the new upstream behavior won't influence the team's workflow in any way.

## Allow external versions

> [!NOTE]
> You must be a feed **Owner** or a feed **Administrator** to allow externally sourced versions. See [Feed permissions](../feeds/feed-permissions.md) for more details.

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and then navigate to your project.

1. Select **Artifacts**, and then select your feed from the dropdown menu.

1. Select your package, and then select the ellipsis button for more options. Select **Allow externally-sourced versions**.

    :::image type="content" source="media\allow-external-versions.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to allow externally sourced versions.":::

1. Select the toggle button to allow external versions. Select **Close** when you're done.

    :::image type="content" source="media\enable-external-versions.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to enable external versions.":::

## Allow external versions using the REST API

#### [NuGet](#tab/nuget/)

- [Set upstreaming behavior](/rest/api/azure/devops/artifactspackagetypes/nuget/set-upstreaming-behavior)
- [Get upstreaming behavior](/rest/api/azure/devops/artifactspackagetypes/nuget/get-upstreaming-behavior)

#### [npm](#tab/npm/)

- [Set upstreaming behavior](/rest/api/azure/devops/artifactspackagetypes/npm/set-upstreaming-behavior)
- [Set scoped upstreaming behavior](/rest/api/azure/devops/artifactspackagetypes/npm/set-scoped-upstreaming-behavior)
- [Get package upstreaming behavior](/rest/api/azure/devops/artifactspackagetypes/npm/get-package-upstreaming-behavior)
- [Get scoped package upstreaming behavior](/rest/api/azure/devops/artifactspackagetypes/npm/get-scoped-package-upstreaming-behavior)

#### [Python](#tab/python/)

- [Get upstreaming behavior](/rest/api/azure/devops/artifactspackagetypes/python/get-upstreaming-behavior)
- [Set upstreaming behavior](/rest/api/azure/devops/artifactspackagetypes/python/set-upstreaming-behavior)

#### [Maven](#tab/maven/)

- [Get upstreaming behavior](/rest/api/azure/devops/artifactspackagetypes/maven/get-upstreaming-behavior)
- [Set upstreaming behavior](/rest/api/azure/devops/artifactspackagetypes/maven/set-upstreaming-behavior)

## Allow external versions using PowerShell

1. [Create a personal access token](../../organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md#create-a-pat) with **Packaging** > **Read, write, & manage** permissions.

    :::image type="content" source="media\packaging-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to select packaging permissions.":::

1. Create an environment variable for your personal access token.

    ```PowerShell
    $env:PATVAR = "YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ```

1. Convert your personal access token to baser64 encoded string and construct the HTTP request header.

    ```PowerShell
    $token = [Convert]::ToBase64String(([Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes("username:$env:PatVar")))
    $headers = @{
        Authorization = "Basic $token"
    }
    ```

1. Construct your endpoint url. Example: //pkgs.dev.azure.com/MyOrg/MyProject/_apis/packaging/feeds/MyFeed/nuget/packages/pkg1.0.0.nupkg/upstreaming?api-version=6.1-preview.1

    - **Project-scoped feed**:

        ```PowerShell
        $url = "https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/<PROJECT_NAME>/_apis/packaging/feeds/<FEED_NAME>/<PROTOCOL>/packages/<PACKAGE_NAME>/upstreaming?api-version=6.1-preview.1"
        ```

    - **Organization-scoped feed**:

        ```PowerShell
        $url = "https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/_apis/packaging/feeds/<FEED_NAME>/<PROTOCOL>/packages/<PACKAGE_NAME>/upstreaming?api-version=6.1-preview.1"
        ```

#### [Get upstreaming behavior](#tab/get/)

Run the following command to retrieve the upstream behavior state of your package. `$url` and `$headers` are the same variables we used in the previous section.

 ```PowerShell
 Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Headers $headers
 ```

#### [Set upstreaming behavior](#tab/set/)

Run the following commands to allow externally sourced versions for your package. This sets `versionsFromExternalUpstreams` to `AllowExternalVersions`, and uses the `$url` and `$headers` variables to query the REST API.

```PowerShell
$body = '{"versionsFromExternalUpstreams": "AllowExternalVersions"}'

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Headers $headers -Body $body -Method Patch -ContentType "application/json"
```

> [!NOTE]
> In some cases, setting up the upstream behavior can take time to propagate across the service. If your package is not available after updating the settings, please allow up to 3 hours for the new settings to take effect.

#### [Clear upstreaming behavior](#tab/clear/)

To clear the upstream behavior for your package, run the following commands to set `versionsFromExternalUpstreams` to `Auto` and query the REST API.

```PowerShell
$body = '{"versionsFromExternalUpstreams": "Auto"}'

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Headers $headers -Body $body -Method Patch -ContentType "application/json"
```
