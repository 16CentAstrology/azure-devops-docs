# What Are Azure Artifacts Feeds?

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Azure Artifacts Feeds are organizational constructs that allow you to store, manage, and share your packages while controlling access. Feeds are not limited to specific package types; you can store various types, such as npm, NuGet, Maven, and Python packages, in a single feed.

## Project-scoped vs Organization-scoped feeds

Organization-scoped feeds are accessible and viewable from any project within the organization. Project-scoped feeds on the other hand, are restricted to being viewed solely within the hosting project.

It's important to note that organization-scoped feeds cannot be converted into project-scoped feeds. Furthermore, only project-scoped feeds have the capability to be designated as [public feeds](#public-feeds). For a detailed comparison between project-scoped and organization-scoped feeds, refer to [Feeds scope](../feeds/project-scoped-feeds.md).

> [!NOTE]
> To access a feed in a different organization, a user must be granted access to the project hosting that feed.

## Create a new feed

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

Follow the instructions below and choose the appropriate scope to create a new project-scoped or organization-scoped feed:

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and then navigate to your project.

1. Select **Artifacts**, and then select **Create Feed**.

1. Enter a descriptive **Name** for your feed and define its **Visibility** (who can use your feed). Specify the **Scope** of your feed, and if you wish to include packages from public sources, mark the **Upstream sources** checkbox.

1. Select **Create** when you're done.

## Public feeds

Public feeds allow you to share your packages publicly with anyone on the internet. Users do not need to be members of your organization, nor do they need an Azure DevOps account to access the packages.

Public feeds are **project-scoped** and inherit the visibility settings of the hosting project. Here are some important points to note about public feeds:

- Public feeds can only be created within public projects.
- Public feeds are not intended to replace existing package management platforms (such as NuGet.org, npmjs.com, etc.).
- Public users currently cannot download universal packages, but all other package types are supported for public access.

> [!NOTE]
> All feed views in a public feed are accessible to everyone on the internet.

## Create public feeds

Public feeds are project-scoped feeds in a public project.

1. Select **Artifacts**.

1. Select **Create Feed**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/new-feed-button-azure-devops-newnav.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the create feed button.":::

1. Give your feed a **Name**, and then select **Project** for your feed's scope.

1. Select **Create** when you are done.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

## Restore deleted feeds

If you accidentally delete a feed, Azure Artifacts provides a 30 days window to recover your feed to its original state. After the 30 days, the feed will be deleted permanently. During the recovery window, the name of the feed remains reserved, packages are unavailable for download, and write access is suspended for that feed.

You can view the feeds that are pending permanent deletion in the feed picker dropdown list under the **Deleted Feeds** tab.

1. Select **Artifacts**.

1. Select the feed picker dropdown menu, and then select **Deleted Feeds**

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Deleted feeds dropdown](media/deleted-feeds.png)

1. Select the feed you want to restore, and then select **Feed Settings**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Feed settings button](media/feed-settings-button.png)

1. Select **Restore Feed**.

## Permanently deleting a feed

A feed pending deletion will still use storage space. If you want to permanently delete your feed before the 30 days period is up, you can do this as follows:

1. Select **Artifacts**.

1. Select the feed picker dropdown menu, and then select **Deleted Feeds**

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Deleted feeds list](media/deleted-feeds.png)

1. Select the feed you want to restore, and then select **Feed Settings**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Feed settings](media/feed-settings-button.png)

1. Select **Permanently Delete Feed**, and then select **Delete**.

Once the feed is permanently deleted, users won't be able to view or restore its packages. The feed name will be available for reuse 15 minutes after the deletion.
