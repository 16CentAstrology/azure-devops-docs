# Share packages publicly

Azure Artifacts provides an easy way to share packages to users outside your organization using public feeds. Packages that are stored in public feeds can be restored, installed, or consumed by anyone on the Internet.

## Prerequisites

- [Azure DevOps Services account](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/).
- [Azure Artifacts feed](../get-started-nuget.md).
- A public project. You can [create a public project](../../organizations/public/create-public-project.md) if you don't have one already.

## Create public feeds

Public feeds are project-scoped feeds in a public project. Public feeds inherit the hosting project's visibility settings.

> [!NOTE]
> Organization-scoped feeds cannot be converted into project-scoped feeds.

1. Navigate to your public project, and then select **Artifacts**.

1. Select **Create Feed**.

1. Give your feed a **Name** and select **Project: PublicProject (Recommended)** for scope.

1. Select **Create** when you are done.

## Publish packages

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Universal Packages are not supported in public feeds.

If you want to publish NuGet packages using the dotnet or nuget CLI, make sure you have the latest [Azure Artifacts Credential Provider](https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider#azure-artifacts-credential-provider).

### Publish packages using the command line

- [Publish and consume NuGet packages](../get-started-nuget.md)
- [Publish and consume npm packages](../get-started-npm.md)
- [Publish and consume Maven artifacts](../get-started-maven.md)
- [Publish and consume Python packages](../quickstarts/python-packages.md)

### Publish packages using Azure Pipelines

- [Publish NuGet packages from Azure Pipelines](../../pipelines/artifacts/nuget.md)
- [Publish npm packages from Azure Pipelines](../../pipelines/artifacts/npm.md)
- [Publish Python packages from Azure Pipelines](../../pipelines/artifacts/pypi.md)
- [Publish Maven artifacts with Gradle](../maven/publish-package-gradle.md)

## Share packages

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Upstream sources are not supported in public feeds.

To share your packages publicly, you can simply post/share your feed URL (example: `https://dev.azure.com/<org_name>/<project_name>/_packaging?_a=feed&feed=<feed_name>`), or share individual packages with [package badges](../package-badges.md).

:::image type="content" source="../media/package-badge.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a NuGet package badge.":::

As long as your project is kept public, anyone can view and download packages from your public feed. Anonymous users will not be able to create new feeds or access the recycle bin.

> [!NOTE]
> Package badges are only available for released versions. The criteria for what is considered a released version depends on the protocol type. Pre-released version numbers will not be displayed in badges, instead the badge will show the latest released version.
