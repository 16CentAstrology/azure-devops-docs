# JitPack upstream source

**Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2020 | Azure DevOps Server 2019 | TFS 2018 - TFS 2017**

With Azure Artifacts, you can consume packages from different public registries such as Maven Central and Google Maven Repository and JitPack. Once you enable upstream sources, Azure Artifacts will save a copy of any package you install from upstream.
