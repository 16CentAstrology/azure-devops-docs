# Use packages from Google Maven Repository

**Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2020 | Azure DevOps Server 2019 | TFS 2018 - TFS 2017**

With Azure Artifacts, developers can enable upstream sources to store packages from different sources such as Google Maven Repository. Once enabled, Azure Artifacts will save a copy of all the packages installed from Google Maven Repository. Azure Artifacts also support other Maven upstream sources such as Maven Central, Gradle Plugins, and JitPack.
