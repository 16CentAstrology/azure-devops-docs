# Use NuGet packages in Visual Studio

**Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2020 | Azure DevOps Server 2019 | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017**

Using Azure Artifacts and Visual Studio, you can set up your development machine to access and install packages from your feeds and public registries such as NuGet.org. 

## Get source URL

To connect Visual Studio to our feed, we must first get the *Source URL*:

[!INCLUDE [Get source URL](nuget-consume-endpoint.md)]

[!INCLUDE [](../includes/nuget/consume.md)]
