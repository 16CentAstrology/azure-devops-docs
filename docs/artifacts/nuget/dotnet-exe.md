# publish and restore NuGet packages using dotnet CLI

**Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2020 | Azure DevOps Server 2019 | TFS 2018 - TFS 2017**

With Azure Artifacts you can publish and restore your NuGet packages to/from your feed and control who can access them. This article will guide you through setting up your project to publish and restore your packages using the dotnet command line interface.

## Project setup

1. Select **Artifacts**, and then select your feed from the dropdown menu. [Create a feed](../get-started-nuget.md#create-a-feed), if you don't have one already. 

1. Select **Connect to feed**.

1. Select **dotnet** from the **NuGet** section.

1. If this is your first time using Azure Artifacts with dotnet, select **Get the tools** to download and install the latest .NET Core SDK and credential provider.

1. Add a *nuget.config* file to your project, in the same folder as your .csproj or .sln file. Paste the following XML snippet into your new file. Your *nuget.config* file should look similar to the following:

- Organization-scoped feed:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <configuration>
      <packageSources>
        <clear />
        <add key="<FEED_NAME>" value="https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/_packaging/<FEED_NAME>/nuget/v3/index.json" />
      </packageSources>
    </configuration>
    ```

- Project-scoped feed:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <configuration>
      <packageSources>
        <clear />
        <add key="<FEED_NAME>" value="https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/<PROJECT_NAME>/_packaging/<FEED_NAME>/nuget/v3/index.json" />
      </packageSources>
    </configuration>
    ```

## Publish NuGet packages

To publish a package to your feed, run the following command in an elevated command prompt. Replace the placeholders with the relevant information:

```Command
dotnet nuget push --source <FEED_NAME> --api-key <ANY_STRING> <PACKAGE_PATH>
``` 

## Restore NuGet packages

To restore your packages, run the following command in an elevated command prompt. The `--interactive` flag is used to prompt the user for credentials.

```Command
dotnet restore --interactive
```

> [!TIP]
> If you want to authenticate with Azure Artifacts from your pipeline, use the [NuGet Authenticate task](../../pipelines/tasks/package/nuget-authenticate.md) to connect  to Azure Artifacts and other NuGet repositories. 
>
> Another way to authenticate programmatically is to use the [Azure Artifacts Credential Provider](https://github.com/Microsoft/artifacts-credprovider) and pass in your credentials using the `VSS_NUGET_EXTERNAL_FEED_ENDPOINTS` [environment variable](https://github.com/Microsoft/artifacts-credprovider/blob/master/README.md#environment-variables).
