# Use approvals and gates to control your deployment

**VSTS**

Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Team Foundation Server (TFS) provide a highly
configurable and manageable pipeline for releases to multiple environments
such as development, staging, QA, and production environments; including
requiring approvals at specific stages.

In this tutorial, you learn about:

You must have completed that tutorial first.

For more information about the ways you can configure approvals for a release, see [Release approvals and gates](../concepts/definitions/release/approvals/index.md).
