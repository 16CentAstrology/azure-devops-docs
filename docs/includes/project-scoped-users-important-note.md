> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The limited visibility features described in this section apply only to interactions through the web portal. With the REST APIs or `azure devops` CLI commands, project members can access the restricted data.
> - Guest users who are members in the limited group with default access in Microsoft Entra ID, can't search for users with the people picker. When the preview feature's turned *off* for the *organization*, or when guest users aren't members of the limited group, guest users can search all Microsoft Entra users, as expected.
