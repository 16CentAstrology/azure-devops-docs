Anytime you create a project, you must choose a process or process template based on the process model selected for your organization or collection. When choosing a process for your project, it's important to understand the following terms: 

- A *process model* refers to the model used to support projects created for an organization (Azure DevOps Services) or project collection (Azure DevOps Server). Only one process model is supported for an organization or collection at a time. A comparison of the three process models&mdash;Inheritance, On-premises XML, and Hosted XML&mdash;is provided in [Customize work tracking](../reference/customize-work.md#collection-level-process-customization).  
- A *process* defines the building blocks of the work item tracking system and supports the Inheritance process model for Azure Boards. This model supports customization of projects through a WYSIWYG user interface. 
- A *process template* defines the building blocks of the work item tracking system as well as other sub-systems you access through Azure Boards or other Azure DevOps services. It supports Hosted XML and On-premises XML process models which support customization of projects through the modification and import of XML definition files.
