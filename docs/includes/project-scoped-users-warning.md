> [!WARNING]  
> Enabling the **Limit user visibility and collaboration to specific projects** preview feature prevents project-scoped users from searching for users added to the organization through Microsoft Entra group membership, rather than through an explicit user invitation. This is an unexpected behavior, and a resolution is in progress. To resolve this issue, disable the **Limit user visibility and collaboration to specific projects** preview feature for the organization.
