You can add users to a project or team, add projects to organizations, and add teams to projects.

* You must have an organization and project. If you don't have a project yet, [create one](../organizations/projects/create-project.md). 
* To add users to an organization, you must be a member of the [Project Collection Administrators group](../organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md). Organization owners are automatically members of this group.
* To add users to a project, you must be a member of the [Project Administrators or Project Collection Administrators groups](../organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md). Any new users added to a project are automatically added to the organization. 
* To add users to a team, you must be a [Team Administrator](../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md), or you must be a member of one of the administrative groups. Any new users added to a team are automatically added to the organization.
