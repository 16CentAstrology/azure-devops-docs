## Install and manage extensions 

An extension is an installable unit that adds new capabilities to your projects. Azure DevOps extensions support the following functions:

- Planning and tracking of work items, sprints, scrums, and so on  
- Build and release flows
- Code testing and tracking
- Collaboration among team members

For example, to support [code search](../project/search/functional-code-search.md), install the [Code Search extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-code-search).

You want to tell your users about extensions and that they can [request an extension](../../marketplace/request-extensions.md). To install and manage extensions, you must be an organization Owner, a member of the Project Collection Administrators group. Or, you can get added to the [Manager role for extensions](../../marketplace/how-to/grant-permissions.md).
