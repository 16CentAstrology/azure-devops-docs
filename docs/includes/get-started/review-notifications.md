## Review and update notifications

A number of notifications are predefined for each project you add. Notifications are based on subscription rules. Subscriptions arise from the following areas:

- [Out-of-the-box or default subscriptions](../../notifications/oob-built-in-notifications.md).
- [Team, organization, and collection-level notifications](../../notifications/manage-team-group-global-organization-notifications.md), managed by a team administrator or member of the Project Collection Administrators group.
- Project notifications, managed by a member of the Project Administrators group.

If users believe they're getting too many notifications, direct them to [opt out of a subscription](../../notifications/manage-your-personal-notifications.md).
