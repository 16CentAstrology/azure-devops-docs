## Add members to the Project Administrators group 

The person who creates a project is automatically added as a member to the **Project Administrators** group. Members of this group have permissions to manage project configuration, repositories, pipeline resources, teams, and all project permissions. 

It's always a good idea to have more than one person who has administrative privileges. To add a user to this group, see [Change permissions at the project level, Add members to the Project Collection Administrators group](../../organizations/security/change-project-level-permissions.md#add-members-to-the-project-administrators-group).
