# Manage change 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/version-vsts-only.md)]

Managing change is an aspect of managing requirements and your project plan. This article provides an overview of the types of changes to monitor and methods for managing change. 

> [!NOTE]
> *Change management is defined as the methods and manners in which a company describes and implements change within both its internal and external processes. ... Developing a structured approach to change is critical to help ensure a beneficial transition while mitigating disruption. Asq.org*  

In keeping with the Agile manifesto that encourages "*Responding to change over following a plan*, how should you manage change? 
 
In keeping with Agile methods, you want to keep your change management process lightweight. The focus here is to gain insight into the types of changes that are occuring, where they arise, and how they impact the team in their ability to deliver. When managing change, consider your business requirements to meet the following scenarios.   

> [!div class="checklist"]  
> - Define and track status of change  
> - Analyze and prioritize change requirements  
> - Monitor and report on changes  
 
 
This article maps Agile change management tasks by project managers to the tools Azure DevOps supports. More detailed information is provided under [Related articles](#related-articles).   


## Where does change arise? How can we minimize change?  

Very briefly, valid changes can occur from a number of areas: 

- Business needs and customer needs change  
- New priorities arise 
- Feature requirements change as new information arises 
- Resources change and organizations change  
- New dependencies are discovered  
- Development or testing takes longer than expected.

### Minimize changes that are avoidable 

Less valid changes that can occur and contribute to scope creep include the following items. Many of these types of changes arise when a team is new to Agile methods and may not have completely adopted an Agile culture.  

- A team member is unclear on a requirement, project scope, or acceptance criteria
- A team member is focused on developing what they believe to be best rather than what is required 
- One or more team members make decisions without communicating with others 
- Requirements aren't clearly articulated 
- Requirements aren't well prioritized 
- No agreement within the team on how to handle change
- Poor estimates
- New requests aren't negotiated
- Stakeholders and customer input isn't sought out early enough or well enough
- Team members don't raise issues proactively. 
 
### Adopt best change management practices

To avoid some of these undesirable changes, you'll want to integrate  best change management practices into your organization culture.  
- Continuous improvement 
- Agile practices and an entrepreneurial mindset  
- Transparent operations
- Daily communication 
- More upfront work to minimize change 
- Early engagement of the change
- Consistent communication
- Senior leader engagement.

## Goals for managing change

To mitigate problems that arise from change, Agile project managers focus on the following goals to manage change: 

- Ensure customer needs are understood and properly scoped and communicated   
- Control scope changes and minimize scope creep  
- Meet business objectives  
- Meet organization, team, and human objectives  
- Keep everyone informed  
- Develop contingency plans in the event of change  
- Identify planned, completed, and incomplete work  
- Support a change management process  
- Assist teams in their continual improvement processes.   

> [!NOTE]
> *What is Scope creep? Scope creep occurs when the deliverables or features of a project expand from what was originally defined, without a commensurate change in additional time or budget.*  
 
## Best practices for managing change

Good practice is to constantly refine the backlog to ensure acceptance criteria is well defined and your team is building the software your customers want. 
 
- Analyze and triage change requests
- Determine the scope impact on current and planned work 
- Assess the risks of accepting or rejecting the change
- Eliminate as many approvals as possible
- Have a light change control form as needed
- Keep all stakeholders and teams involved. 

### Questions to ask before accepting a change

- Does it serve the sprint goal?    
- Is there a clear business value for the change? 
- Upon release, sill the customer use the result of the scope change?
- What is the urgency for the change request?
- If new scope is added to the sprint backlog, is there something that can be removed? 

### Avoid scope creep  
1. Know your project goals from the start
2. Get serious about documenting requirements
3. Use project management software to keep everyone on track
4. Create a change control process
5. Set (and stick to) a clear schedule
6. Learn the proper ways to communicate with stakeholders and your team
7. Protect your team against “Gold plating”

## Options for tracking change 

You can track changes informally or formally. The more informal tracking, while lightweight in process, leads to less capability to track the change. In the end, the way you track changes should mesh with the change management culture established in your organization. 

The methods you adopt will depend on several factors, such as the following:
- Change management processes adopted by your organization
- The need to maintain an audit trail 
- Communicate changes occurring across teams.

You have several choices for tracking change. From most lightweight to most robust, you can use one or more of the following methods: 

- Add information to an existing user story or work item that identifies the change
- Tag user stories or work items with a change management tag 
- Log changes to the backlog using a formal change request form  

With any of these methods, you can generate a query, review and triage the change. In many cases, how you choose to track change should align with how you and your team choose to monitor and report the scope of change. When early on in the adoption of Agile methods, the need to monitor and track change may be greater than when a team has managed to forge an Agile culture. 

In general, we recommend that you keep the process lightweight and eliminate as much waste as possible.


### Change request form 

To formally track change, you may want to define a change request work item type, similar to the one shown in the following image for the [Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) process](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process).

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Change request work item form.](media/manage-change/change-request-form.png) 

This form provides rich-text fields to capture the impact of the change on the following areas: 
- Architecture
- User experience
- Test
- Design and development
- Technical publications 

You can adopt this form or customize your own to track the changes of most interest to your organization's needs. You can also customize your backlog to have change requests appear on your backlog along with other user stories or requirements. 
 
Also, you can customize your backlogs and boards to manage change request work items alongside requirements. 


### Ensure acceptance criteria is well defined

The Definition of Done is the criteria necessary in order to consider something done or complete. It is most often created for User Stories to ensure the team agrees what is required to finish a story, but also can be created for Sprints themselves for the team to agree on when a Sprint is done.

Ensures that all team members (including the Product Owner) understand what is required for a User Story to be completed within a sprint. If this is not established early for a scrum team, it is possible to get to the sprint demo and have stories that team members think are done, but in reality, have not been fully implemented. "Wait, I was supposed to write automated unit tests too?"

**Example 1: A Product Backlog Item is considered “Done” when the following objectives have been met:**

- Solution builds successfully.
- Code written and merged into main branch
- Unit Tests implemented on all features to an appropriate code coverage
- All regression tests run and pass
- All acceptance criteria met
- Code has been peer reviewed and comments addressed
- User Story moved to Resolved state
- Remaining hours for tasks set to zero and tasks closed.
- No open Sev1 or Sev2 bugs
- Deploys successfully to non development environment (automated)
- Static Code Analysis is run with results no worse than the baseline.

**Example 2: A Sprint is considered “Done” when  the following objectives have been met:**
- The time period allocated for the Sprint has passed
- Unfinished work has been moved to the Backlog
- Completed work has been deployed to target environment(s) and demoed in a Sprint Review to the Product Owner
- Sprint Summary email has been sent to the team detailing:
- User Stories Completed
- Velocity of the sprint
- Sprint Burndown
- Notable accomplishments, highlights, or milestones that were hit
- Retrospective conducted.


## Manage change at the product plan level 

From an Agile methodology point of view you can minimize the need to track changes by following these suggestions: 
- Constantly refine the product plan and product backlog for dependencies, risks 
- Ensure the acceptance criteria and requirements are well understood at the start of a sprint 
- Work to minimize accepting changes after the start of the sprint, while still adhering to Agile principles 

> [!NOTE]
> *Continuous Improvement is a Scrum approach in which the team learns from experience and stakeholder engagement to constantly keep the Prioritized Product Backlog updated with any changes in requirements.*

## Manage change during a sprint 
 
Here are the main ways you can track change: 
- Track changes to requirements within the requirement work item through discussions, changes to acceptance criteria, or attachments
- Add a *change* tag to work items to support tracking changes to the scope of work 
- Add a bug that tracks a change in scope or additional work 
- Add a change request work item type to formally track 
- Set up notifications to automatically communicate change within your team or organization 

 
## Monitor and report on changes    


How to monitor change? Goals and methods.  

The main methods for monitoring change are through work item queries. With queries you can find and triage a list of change management requests or work items tagged with a change management tag. 

In addition, you can filter work items that 
- Monitor and review change additions - query by tag or work items 
- Monitor scope creep - sprint burndown 
- Review was ever queries 


### Monitor scope creep 

Two charts that can help with monitoring scope creep are the sprint burndown and release burndown charts. Sprint burndown provides a visual of how much work

## Get notified of changes 

Azure DevOps provides a robust alert system, allowing project members to set alerts for themselves, a team, or a project.   

As changes occur to work items, code reviews, source control files, and builds, you can receive email notifications. For example, you can set an alert to be notified whenever a bug that you opened is resolved or a work item is assigned to you. You can set personal alerts, team, project, or organization alerts. 

To support change management, you can set up alerts to go out to your team for the following instances: 
- Change request is filed 
- A requirement is tagged with a change request tag

Business Case for Action to define what the change is
- From-To Definition to identify gaps between “is” and “will be”
- Key Role Mapping to identify where Sponsors are needed, and who specifically these individuals are by name
- Readiness Planning to have strategies and tactics available to manage resistance
- Communication Planning by audience, with feedback loops to gather feedback that identifies potential sources of resistance

Minimize these types of change: 
- Poorly understood acceptance criteria 
- what more? 

Log change to the backlog or change tracker
Eliminate as many approvals as possible
Have a light change control form, if necessary
Keep the stakeholders and operations involved
