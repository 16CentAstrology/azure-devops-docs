# About pipeline resources

A [resources](resources.md) is anything used by a pipeline that lives outside the pipeline. Resources are:
* a way to share information such as secure files across pipelines
* a tool for enhancing security through access checks and other restrictions
* a way to improve traceability for your pipeline and make it easier to troubleshoot [environments](environments.md)

Resources are a way to share information across pipelines. Good examples of using resources for sharing are variable groups, secure files, and service connections. In all these cases, you're using a resource as a way for a pipeline to access and consume something. 

Resources are also useful for restricting access and making sure your valuable information is shared with the fewest number of authorized users. For example, you can limit a service connection to only run on one pipeline or make sure that a repository can only be used with a manual approval check. 

You can also use resources for better traceability. When you use resources in a YAML pipeline, you can trace the lifecycle of your resources. For example, you'll be able to see the version of a package that gets consumed in a pipeline. When resources are combined with environments, you can see any resources such as containers that are consumed within a specific environment. 
## Share resources across pipelines

You can share resources across pipelines by configuring resources within the pipelines UI and then referencing those resources in a task. You can also access some shared resources with the [`resources` YAML pipeline syntax](resources.md). 

Examples of sharing resources with the pipelines UI include [secure files](../library/secure-files.md), [variable groups](../library/variable-groups.md), and [service connections](../../extend/develop/service-endpoints.md). With the `resources` syntax, examples include accessing pipelines themselves, repositories, and packages.  

For example, to use variable groups in a pipeline, you'll first add your variables at **Pipelines** > **Library**. Then, you can reference the variable group in your YAML pipeline with the `variables` syntax in a YAML pipeline or by linking a variable group using the Classic editor.

```yml
variables:
- group: my-variable-group
``` 

To call a second pipeline from your pipeline with the `resources` syntax, you would use reference `pipelines`. 

```yml
resources:
  pipelines:
  - pipeline: SmartHotel-resource # identifier for the resource (used in pipeline resource variables)
    source: SmartHotel-CI # name of the pipeline that produces an artifact
```

## Use pipelines for enhanced security

You can enhance your pipeline's security with resources by identifying how that resource gets consumed, how to prevent bad code from running, and how to prevent an unauthorized access. 

One way to restrict resources is by setting them as [protected or open](../security/resources.md). You can use approvals and checks with protected resources and limit them to specific users and pipelines. Protected resources include service connections, agent pools, environments, repositories, variable groups, and secure files. 



|Resource  |How is it consumed?  |How can you prevent a malicious script in a pipeline from using this?  |How do you prevent an unintended pipeline from using this?  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|[service connections](../library/service-endpoints.md)     |    Consumed by tasks in a YAML file that use the service connection as an input.    |    There is no API to read a service connection. A service connection gets declared in a YAML file.   |     Protected with checks and access restrictions.  |
|[variable groups](../library/variable-groups.md) and [secure files](../library/secure-files.md)    |    A special syntax exists for using variable groups in a pipeline or in a job. A variable group gets added like a service connection.     |    Variable groups get declared in a YAML file.     |  Protected with checks and pipeline permissions.   |
|[agent pools](../agents/agents.md) |   There is a special syntax to use an agent pool to run a job.      |    There's no API to run a script on an agent pool. Agent pools must be declared in a YAML file.     |    Protected with checks and pipeline permissions. Checks and pipeline permissions are controlled by agent pool users. A resource owner can control which pipelines can access an agent pool. You can also use pipeline permissions to restrict access to a particular pipeline.      |
|[environments](../process/environments.md) |   There's a special syntax to use an environment in a YAML.      |    There's no API to run a script on an environment. Environments must be declared in a YAML file.     |    Protected  with checks and pipeline permissions that are controlled by environment users. You can also use pipeline permissions to restrict access to a particular environment.      |
|[repositories](resources.md#resources-repositories)     |   A script can clone a repository if the job access token has access to the repo.   |   There's an API to clone repositories. You can also use a project setting to prevent undeclared repositories from being accessed in a script. When enabled, ACLs for the repository are added to the job access token on if it is explicitly declared in the resources section.       |  Protected with checks and pipeline permissions controlled by repository contributors. A repository owner can restrict ownership.      |
|[artifacts](../artifacts/artifacts-overview.md), work items, [pipelines](resources.md#resources-pipelines)     |   [Pipeline artifacts](../artifacts/artifacts-overview.md) are resources, but [Azure Artifacts](/azure/devops/artifacts/) are not.  Artifacts on their own are not resources. A script can download artifacts if the job access token has access to the feed. An (pipeline) artifact can be explicitly declared as a resource in the resources section â€“ primarily for the intent of triggering the pipeline when a new artifact is available, or to consume that artifact in the pipeline. |    Job access tokens have read permissions on artifacts within their scope (project or collection). You can restrict the job access token to be project-scoped instead of collection scoped and limit the access to feeds within the project. If I have access to a project, then I can see all the artifacts and feeds. There is no way to add permission restrictions to specific feeds (as declared in the resources section) to a job access token. |    Artifacts are not protected. Checks and pipeline permissions for feeds are not supported.    |
|[containers](resources.md#resources-containers), [packages](resources.md#resources-packages), [webhooks](resources.md#resources-webhooks)      |    These live outside the Azure DevOps ecosystem and access gets controlled with service connections. There is a special syntax for using all three types in YAML pipelines. |       |     Protected with checks and pipeline permissions controlled by service connection users.     |


There are some resources that live outside of the Azure DevOps ecosystem. Access to these resources is controlled with service connections. 
- [containers](resources.md#resources-containers)
- [packages](resources.md#resources-packages)
- [webhooks](resources.md#resources-webhooks)

## Use resources for traceability in environments

You can combine resources with environments so that you can better track resource use. [Environments](environments.md) are collections of resources using in pipelines. For Classic release pipelines, [deployment groups](../release/deployment-groups/index.md) offer similar traceability tools. 

Environments support two resource types:
- [Kubernetes](environments-kubernetes.md)
- [Virtual machines](environments-virtual-machines.md)
