# About pipeline resources

A resource is anything used by a pipeline that lives outside the pipeline. [Resources](resources.md) are defined at one place and can be consumed anywhere in your pipeline. 

There are three types of resources:
- Resources that get consumed (secure files, variable groups, pipelines, repositories, packages, service connections)
- Resources that get triggered (repositories, artifacts, pipeline triggers, webhooks)  
- Resources that run on something (environments, agent pools, containers)

Resources can be [protected or open](../security/resources.md). You can use approvals and checks with protected resources and limit them to specific users and pipelines. Protected resources include service connections, agent pools, environments, and repositories.

## Use resources in a pipeline


## Resources security

It's useful to think about resources are used, how to prevent malicious code, and how to prevent an authorized pipeline from having access. 


|Resource  |How is it consumed?  |How can you prevent a malicious script in a pipeline from using this?  |How do you prevent an unintended pipeline from using this?  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|[service connections](../library/service-endpoints.md)     |    Consumed by tasks in a YAML file that use the service connection as an input.    |    There is no API to read a service connection. A service connection gets declared in a YAML file.   |     Checks and pipeline permissions controlled by service connection users.     |
|[variable groups](../library/variable-groups.md) and [secure files](../library/secure-files.md)    |    A special syntax exists for using variable groups in a pipeline or in a job. A variable group gets added like a service connection.     |    Variable groups get declared in a YAML file.     |  Authors have access to variable groups.    |
|[agent pools](../agents/agents.md) |   There is a special syntax to use an agent pool to run a job.      |    There's no API to run a script on an agent pool. Agent pools must be declared in a YAML file.     |    Checks and pipeline permissions are controlled by agent pool users. A resource owner can control which pipelines can access an agent pool. You can also use pipeline permissions to restrict access to a particular pipeline.      |
|[environments](../process/environments.md) |   There's a special syntax to use an environment in a YAML.      |    There's no API to run a script on an environment. Environments must be declared in a YAML file.     |    Checks and pipeline permissions are controlled by environment users. You can also use pipeline permissions to restrict access to a particular environment.      |
|[repositories](resources.md#resources-repositories)     |   A script can clone a repository if the job access token has access to the repo.   |   There's an API to clone repositories. You can also use a project setting to prevent undeclared repositories from being accessed in a script. When enabled, ACLs for the repository are added to the job access token on if it is explicitly declared in the resources section.       |   Checks and pipeline permissions controlled by repository contributors. A repository owner can restrict ownership.      |
|[artifacts](../artifacts/artifacts-overview.md), work items, [pipelines](resources.md#resources-pipelines)     |   [Pipeline artifacts](../artifacts/artifacts-overview.md) are resources, but [Azure Artifacts](/azure/devops/artifacts/) are not.  Artifacts on their own are not resources. A script can download artifacts if the job access token has access to the feed. An (pipeline) artifact can be explicitly declared as a resource in the resources section â€“ primarily for the intent of triggering the pipeline when a new artifact is available, or to consume that artifact in the pipeline. |    Job access tokens have read permissions on artifacts within their scope (project or collection). You can restrict the job access token to be project-scoped instead of collection scoped and limit the access to feeds within the project. If I have access to a project, then I can see all the artifacts and feeds. There is no way to add permission restrictions to specific feeds (as declared in the resources section) to a job access token. |    Checks and pipeline permissions for feeds are not supported     |
|[containers](resources.md#resources-containers), [packages](resources.md#resources-packages), [webhooks](resources.md#resources-webhooks)      |    These live outside the Azure DevOps ecosystem and access gets controlled with service connections. There is a special syntax for using all three types in YAML pipelines. |       |     Checks and pipeline permissions controlled by service connection users.     |


There are some resources that live outside of the Azure DevOps ecosystem. Access to these resources is controlled with service connections. 
- [containers](resources.md#resources-containers)
- [packages](resources.md#resources-packages)
- [webhooks](resources.md#resources-webhooks)
