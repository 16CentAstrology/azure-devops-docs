* You can create organizations in Azure DevOps just like you can in GitHub. To get started, you need an Azure DevOps organization. If you don't have one, you can [create one for free](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=307137). If your team already has an Azure DevOps organization, then make sure you're an administrator of its project that you want to use. An Azure DevOps organization is different from your GitHub organization. It's common to give it the same name as your GitHub organization so that there's alignment between them.
