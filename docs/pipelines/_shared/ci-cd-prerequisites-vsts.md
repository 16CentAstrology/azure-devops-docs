* You can create organizations in Azure DevOps just like you can in GitHub. To get started, you need an Azure DevOps organization. If you don't have one, you can [create one for free](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=307137). If your team already has one, then make sure you're an administrator of the Azure DevOps project you want to use.
