# Build Azure Repos Git or TFS Git repositories

[!INCLUDE [version-tfs-2015-rtm](../includes/version-tfs-2015-rtm.md)]

Azure Pipelines can automatically build and validate every pull request and commit to your Azure Repos Git repository.

## Choose a repository to build

# [YAML](#tab/yaml/)

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

You create a new pipeline by first selecting a repository and then a YAML file in that repository. The repository in which the YAML file is present is called `self` repository. By default, this is the repository that your pipeline builds. 

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

You can later configure your pipeline to check out a different repository or multiple repositories. To learn how to do this, see [multi-repo checkout](multi-repo-checkout.md).

YAML pipelines are not available in TFS.

# [Classic](#tab/classic/)

While creating a pipeline, to choose the repository to build, first select the project to which the repository belongs. Then, select the repository.

To clone additional repositories as part of your pipeline:

* If the repo is in the same project as your pipeline, or if the access token (explained below) has access to the repository in a different project, use the following command:

  `git clone -c http.extraheader="AUTHORIZATION: bearer $(System.AccessToken)" <clone URL>`

* If the access token (explained below) does not have access to the repository:

    1. Get a [personal access token (PAT)](../../organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md) with `Code (read)` scope, and prefix it with `pat:`
    2. Base64-encode this string to create a basic auth token.
    3. Add a script in your pipeline with the following command to clone that repo
       `git clone -c http.extraheader="AUTHORIZATION: basic <BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN>" <clone URL>`

Azure Pipelines must be granted access to your repositories to trigger their builds and fetch their code during builds. Access to the repository is governed by permissions of job access tokens. A **job access token** is a security token that is dynamically generated by Azure Pipelines for each job at run time. The token's permissions are derived from (a) job authorization scope and (b) the permissions you set on project or collection build service account.

### Job authorization scope

You can set the job authorization scope to be **collection** or **project**. By setting the scope to **collection**, you choose to let pipelines access all repositories in the collection or organization. By setting the scope to **project**, you choose to restrict access to only those repositories that are in the same project as the pipeline.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml/)

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

Job authorization scope can be set for the entire Azure DevOps organization or for a specific project. 

To set job authorization scope for the organization:

- Navigate to your organization settings page in the Azure DevOps user interface.
- Select **Settings** under **Pipelines**.
- Turn on the toggle **Limit job authorization scope to current project** to limit the scope to project. This is the recommended setting, as it enhances security for your pipelines.

To set job authorization scope for a specific project:

- Navigate to your project settings page in the Azure DevOps user interface.
- Select **Settings** under **Pipelines**.
- Turn on the toggle **Limit job authorization scope to current project** to limit the scope to project. This is the recommended setting, as it enhances security for your pipelines.

>[!NOTE]
>If the scope is set to **project** at the organization level, you cannot change the scope in each project.

>[!IMPORTANT]
If the scope is not restricted at either the organization level or project level, then every job in your YAML pipeline gets a collection scoped job access token. In other words, your pipeline has access to any repository in any project of your organization. If an adversary is able to gain access to a single pipeline in a single project, he or she will be able to gain access to any repository in your organization. This is why, it is recommended that you restrict the scope at the highest level (organization settings) in order to contain the attack to a single project.

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"

If you use Azure DevOps Server 2019, then all YAML jobs run with the job authorization scope set to **collection**. In other words, these jobs have access to all repositories in your project collection. You cannot change this in Azure DevOps server 2019.

YAML pipelines are not available in TFS.

>[!NOTE]
>If the scope is set to **project** at the organization level, you cannot change the scope in each project.

To set job authorization scope for a specific pipeline:

- Navigate to the pipeline in the **Pipelines** page.
- Select **Edit** to edit the pipeline.
- In the **Options** tab, select **Project collection** or **Current project** for **Build job authorization scope**.
- Save the build pipeline.

>[!NOTE]
>If the scope if restricted to **project** in the organization or project level settings, then the pipeline-level job authorization scope is ignored. The project or organization level setting prevails.

>[!IMPORTANT]
If the scopes are not restricted at either the organization level or project level, then you are allowing the pipeline authors to determine the access they need to repositories. If an adversary is able to create or edit a pipeline in one project, he or she will be able to gain access to any repository in your organization. This is why, it is recommended that you restrict the scope at the highest level (organization settings) in order to contain the attack to a single project.

Job authorization scope can be set for each pipeline. To set this scope:

- Navigate to the pipeline in the **Pipelines** page.
- Select **Edit** to edit the pipeline.
- In the **Options** tab, select **Project collection** or **Current project** for **Build job authorization scope**.
- Save the build pipeline.

>[!NOTE]
> If your pipeline is in a **pubic project**, then the job authorization scope is automatically restricted to **project** no matter what you configure in any setting. Jobs in a public project can access resources such as build artifacts or test results only within the project and not from other projects of the organization.

### Build service account

You may want to change the permissions of build access token in scenarios such as the following:

- You want your pipeline to access a feed that is in a different project.
- You want your pipeline to be restricted from changing code in the repository.
- You want your pipeline to be restricted from creating work items.

To update the permissions of build access token:

- First, determine the job authorization scope for your pipeline. See the section above to understand job authorization scope. If the job authorization scope is **collection**, then the corresponding build service account to manage permissions on is **Project Collection Build Service (<your collection name>)**. If the job authorization scope is **project**, then the build service account to manage permissions on is **<Your project name> Build Service (<your collection name>)**.

- To restrict or grant additional access to **Project Collection Build Service (<your collection name>)**:
  - Select **Manage security** in the overflow menu on **Pipelines** page.
  - Under **Users**, select **Project Collection Build Service (<your collection name>)**.
  - Make any changes to the pipelines-related permissions for this account.
  - Navigate to organization settings for your Azure DevOps organization (or collection settings for your project collection).
  - Select **Permissions** under **Security**.
  - Under the **Users** tab, look for **Project Collection Build Service (<your collection name>)**.
  - Make any changes to the non-pipelines-related permissions for this account.
  - Since **Project Collection Build Service (<your collection name>)** is a user in your organization or collection, you can add this account explicitly to any resource - for e.g., to a feed in Azure Artifacts.

- To restrict or grant additional access to **<Your project name> Build Service (<your collection name>)**:
  - The build service account on which you can manage permissions will only be created after you run the pipeline once. Make sure that you already ran the pipeline once.
  - Select **Manage security** in the overflow menu on **Pipelines** page.
  - Under **Users**, select **<Your project name> Build Service (<your collection name>)**.
  - Make any changes to the pipelines-related permissions for this account.
  - Navigate to organization settings for your Azure DevOps organization (or collection settings for your project collection).
  - Select **Permissions** under **Security**.
  - Under the **Users** tab, look for **<Your project name> build service (<your collection name>)**.
  - Make any changes to the non-pipelines-related permissions for this account.
  - Since **<Your project name> Build Service (<your collection name>)** is a user in your organization or collection, you can add this account explicitly to any resource - for e.g., to a feed in Azure Artifacts.

## CI triggers

[!INCLUDE [ci-triggers](includes/ci-triggers.md)]

## Pull request validation

Pull request (PR) triggers cause a build to run whenever a pull request is opened with one of the specified target branches, or when changes are pushed to such a pull request. In Azure Repos Git, this functionality is implemented using branch policies. To enable pull request validation in Azure Git Repos, navigate to the branch policies for the desired branch, and configure the [Build validation policy](../../repos/git/branch-policies.md#build-validation) for that branch. For more information, see [Configure branch policies](../../repos/git/branch-policies.md).

>[!NOTE]
>To configure validation builds for an Azure Repos Git repository, you must be a project administrator of its project.

::: moniker range=">tfs-2018"

### Validate contributions from forks

Building pull requests from Azure Repos forks is no different from building pull requests within the same repository or project. You can create forks only within the same organization that your project is part of.

## Pricing

Azure Pipelines is free for Azure Repos Git repositories, with multiple free offerings available depending on whether your Azure DevOps project is public or private.

If your Azure Repos Git repository is open source, you can make your Azure DevOps project **public** so that anyone can view your pipeline's build results, logs, and test results without signing in. When users submit pull requests, they can view the status of builds that automatically validate those pull requests.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Repos Git repositories do not support forks by users who do not have explicit access to the project.

If your project is public, you can run up to 10 parallel jobs in Azure Pipelines for free. These free jobs have a maximum timeout of 360 minutes (6 hours) each. If your project is private, we still provide a free tier. In this tier, you can run one free parallel job that can run up to 60 minutes each time until you've used 1800 minutes per month. For more information, see [parallel jobs](../licensing/concurrent-jobs.md).

For more information on public projects, see [Create a public project](../../organizations/public/create-public-project.md).
