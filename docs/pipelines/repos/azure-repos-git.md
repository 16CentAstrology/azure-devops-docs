# Build Azure Repos Git or TFS Git repositories

Azure Pipelines can automatically build and validate every pull request and commit to your Azure Repos Git repository.

## Choose a repository to build

# [YAML](#tab/yaml/)

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

You create a new pipeline by first selecting a repository and then a YAML file in that repository. The repository in which the YAML file is present is called `self` repository. By default, this is the repository that your pipeline builds. 

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

You can later configure your pipeline to check out a different repository or multiple repositories. To learn how to do this, see [multi-repo checkout](multi-repo-checkout.md).

::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2019"

YAML pipelines are not available in TFS.

::: moniker-end

# [Classic](#tab/classic/)

While creating a pipeline, to choose the repository to build, first select the project to which the repository belongs. Then, select the repository.

To clone additional repositories as part of your pipeline:

* If the repo is in the same project as your pipeline, or if the access token (explained below) has access to the repository in a different project, use the following command:

  `git clone -c http.extraheader="AUTHORIZATION: bearer $(System.AccessToken)" <clone URL>`

* If the access token (explained below) does not have access to the repository:

    1. Get a [personal access token (PAT)](../../organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md) with `Code (read)` scope, and prefix it with `pat:`
    2. Base64-encode this string to create a basic auth token.
    3. Add a script in your pipeline with the following command to clone that repo
       `git clone -c http.extraheader="AUTHORIZATION: basic <BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN>" <clone URL>`

---

Azure Pipelines must be granted access to your repositories to trigger their builds and fetch their code during builds. Normally, a pipeline has access to repositories in the same project. But, if you wish to access repositories in a different project, then you need to understand how job access tokens work. A **job access token** is a security token that is dynamically generated by Azure Pipelines for each job at run time. The token's permissions are derived from (a) job authorization scope and (b) the permissions you set on project or collection build service account.

### Job authorization scope

You can set the job authorization scope to be **collection** or **project**. By setting the scope to **collection**, you choose to let pipelines access all repositories in the collection or organization. By setting the scope to **project**, you choose to restrict access to only those repositories that are in the same project as the pipeline.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml/)

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

Job authorization scope can be set for the entire Azure DevOps organization or for a specific project. 

To set job authorization scope for the organization:

- Navigate to your organization settings page in the Azure DevOps user interface.
- Select **Settings** under **Pipelines**.
- Turn on the toggle **Limit job authorization scope to current project** to limit the scope to project. This is the recommended setting, as it enhances security for your pipelines.

To set job authorization scope for a specific project:

- Navigate to your project settings page in the Azure DevOps user interface.
- Select **Settings** under **Pipelines**.
- Turn on the toggle **Limit job authorization scope to current project** to limit the scope to project. This is the recommended setting, as it enhances security for your pipelines.

>[!NOTE]
>If the scope is set to **project** at the organization level, you cannot change the scope in each project.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> If the scope is not restricted at either the organization level or project level, then every job in your YAML pipeline gets a collection scoped job access token. In other words, your pipeline has access to any repository in any project of your organization. If an adversary is able to gain access to a single pipeline in a single project, he or she will be able to gain access to any repository in your organization. This is why, it is recommended that you restrict the scope at the highest level (organization settings) in order to contain the attack to a single project.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"

If you use Azure DevOps Server 2019, then all YAML jobs run with the job authorization scope set to **collection**. In other words, these jobs have access to all repositories in your project collection. You cannot change this in Azure DevOps server 2019.

YAML pipelines are not available in TFS.

To set job authorization scope for a specific pipeline:

- Navigate to the pipeline in the **Pipelines** page.
- Select **Edit** to edit the pipeline.
- In the **Options** tab, select **Project collection** or **Current project** for **Build job authorization scope**.
- Save the build pipeline.

>[!NOTE]
>If the scope if restricted to **project** in the organization or project level settings, then the pipeline-level job authorization scope is ignored. The project or organization level setting prevails.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If the scopes are not restricted at either the organization level or project level, then you are allowing the pipeline authors to determine the access they need to repositories. If an adversary is able to create or edit a pipeline in one project, he or she will be able to gain access to any repository in your organization. This is why, it is recommended that you restrict the scope at the highest level (organization settings) in order to contain the attack to a single project.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"

Job authorization scope can be set for each pipeline. To set this scope:

- Navigate to the pipeline in the **Pipelines** page.
- Select **Edit** to edit the pipeline.
- In the **Options** tab, select **Project collection** or **Current project** for **Build job authorization scope**.
- Save the build pipeline.

::: moniker-end

---

>[!NOTE]
> If your pipeline is in a **pubic project**, then the job authorization scope is automatically restricted to **project** no matter what you configure in any setting. Jobs in a public project can access resources such as build artifacts or test results only within the project and not from other projects of the organization.

### Build service account

You may want to change the permissions of build access token in scenarios such as the following:

- You want your pipeline to access a feed that is in a different project.
- You want your pipeline to be restricted from changing code in the repository.
- You want your pipeline to be restricted from creating work items.

To update the permissions of build access token:

- First, determine the job authorization scope for your pipeline. See the section above to understand job authorization scope. If the job authorization scope is **collection**, then the corresponding build service account to manage permissions on is **Project Collection Build Service (your-collection-name)**. If the job authorization scope is **project**, then the build service account to manage permissions on is **Your-project-name Build Service (your-collection-name)**.

- To restrict or grant additional access to **Project Collection Build Service (your-collection-name)**:
  - Select **Manage security** in the overflow menu on **Pipelines** page.
  - Under **Users**, select **Project Collection Build Service (your-collection-name)**.
  - Make any changes to the pipelines-related permissions for this account.
  - Navigate to organization settings for your Azure DevOps organization (or collection settings for your project collection).
  - Select **Permissions** under **Security**.
  - Under the **Users** tab, look for **Project Collection Build Service (your-collection-name)**.
  - Make any changes to the non-pipelines-related permissions for this account.
  - Since **Project Collection Build Service (your-collection-name)** is a user in your organization or collection, you can add this account explicitly to any resource - for e.g., to a feed in Azure Artifacts.

- To restrict or grant additional access to **Your-project-name Build Service (your-collection-name)**:
  - The build service account on which you can manage permissions will only be created after you run the pipeline once. Make sure that you already ran the pipeline once.
  - Select **Manage security** in the overflow menu on **Pipelines** page.
  - Under **Users**, select **Your-project-name Build Service (your-collection-name)**.
  - Make any changes to the pipelines-related permissions for this account.
  - Navigate to organization settings for your Azure DevOps organization (or collection settings for your project collection).
  - Select **Permissions** under **Security**.
  - Under the **Users** tab, look for **Your-project-name build service (your-collection-name)**.
  - Make any changes to the non-pipelines-related permissions for this account.
  - Since **Your-project-name Build Service (your-collection-name)** is a user in your organization or collection, you can add this account explicitly to any resource - for e.g., to a feed in Azure Artifacts.

## CI triggers

Continuous integration (CI) triggers cause a pipeline to run whenever you push an update to the specified branches or you push  specified tags.

### Skipping CI for individual commits

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"

You can also tell Azure Pipelines to skip running a pipeline that a commit would normally trigger. Just include `***NO_CI***` in the commit message of the HEAD commit and Azure Pipelines will skip running CI.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="> azure-devops-2019"

You can also tell Azure Pipelines to skip running a pipeline that a commit would normally trigger. Just include `[skip ci]` in the commit message or description of the HEAD commit and Azure Pipelines will skip running CI. You can also use any of the variations below.

- `[skip ci]` or `[ci skip]`
- `skip-checks: true` or `skip-checks:true`
- `[skip azurepipelines]` or `[azurepipelines skip]`
- `[skip azpipelines]` or `[azpipelines skip]`
- `[skip azp]` or `[azp skip]`
- `***NO_CI***`

::: moniker-end

[!INCLUDE [ci-triggers](includes/ci-triggers5.md)]

## PR triggers

Pull request (PR) triggers cause a build to run whenever a pull request is opened with one of the specified target branches, or when changes are pushed to such a pull request. In Azure Repos Git, this functionality is implemented using branch policies. To enable pull request validation in Azure Git Repos, navigate to the branch policies for the desired branch, and configure the [Build validation policy](../../repos/git/branch-policies.md#build-validation) for that branch. For more information, see [Configure branch policies](../../repos/git/branch-policies.md).

>[!NOTE]
>To configure validation builds for an Azure Repos Git repository, you must be a project administrator of its project.

::: moniker range=">tfs-2018"

### Validate contributions from forks

Building pull requests from Azure Repos forks is no different from building pull requests within the same repository or project. You can create forks only within the same organization that your project is part of.

## Pricing

Azure Pipelines is free for Azure Repos Git repositories, with multiple free offerings available depending on whether your Azure DevOps project is public or private.

If your Azure Repos Git repository is open source, you can make your Azure DevOps project **public** so that anyone can view your pipeline's build results, logs, and test results without signing in. When users submit pull requests, they can view the status of builds that automatically validate those pull requests.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Repos Git repositories do not support forks by users who do not have explicit access to the project.

If your project is public, you can run up to 10 parallel jobs in Azure Pipelines for free. These free jobs have a maximum timeout of 360 minutes (6 hours) each. If your project is private, we still provide a free tier. In this tier, you can run one free parallel job that can run up to 60 minutes each time until you've used 1800 minutes per month. For more information, see [parallel jobs](../licensing/concurrent-jobs.md).

For more information on public projects, see [Create a public project](../../organizations/public/create-public-project.md).

## Q & A

### How do I determine the job authorization scope of my YAML pipeline?

* If the pipeline is in a public project, then the job authorization scope is **project**.
* If the pipeline is in a private project, check the Pipeline settings under your Azure DevOps **organization settings**:
  * If the toggle for "Limit job authorization scope to current project" is enabled, then the scope is **project**.
  * If the toggle is not enabled, then check the Pipeline settings under your **project settings** in Azure DevOps:
    * If the toggle for "Limit job authorization scope to current project" is enabled, then the scope is **project**.
    * Or else, the scope is **collection**.

### How do I determine the job authorization scope of my classic build pipeline?

* If the pipeline is in a public project, then the job authorization scope is **project**.
* If the pipeline is in a private project, check the Pipeline settings under your Azure DevOps **organization settings**:
  * If the toggle for "Limit job authorization scope to current project" is enabled, then the scope is **project**.
  * If the toggle is not enabled, then check the Pipeline settings under your **project settings** in Azure DevOps:
    * If the toggle for "Limit job authorization scope to current project" is enabled, then the scope is **project**.
    * If the toggle is not enabled, open the editor for the pipeline, and navigate to the **Options** tab.
      * If the **Build job authorization scope** is **Current project**, then scope is **project**.
      * Or else, scope is **collection**.

### I see the following permission error in the log file during checkout step. How do I fix it?

```log
remote: TF401019: The Git repository with name or identifier XYZ does not exist or you do not have permissions for the operation you are attempting.
fatal: repository 'XYZ' not found
##[error]Git fetch failed with exit code: 128
```

* First, check if the repository still exists.
* Determine the job authorization scope of the pipeline using the steps suggested above.
  * If the scope is **collection**: 
    * This may be an intermittent error. Re-run the pipeline.
    * Someone may have removed the access to **Project Collection Build Service account**.
      * Go to the **project settings** of the project in which the repository exists. Select Repos -> Repositories -> specific repository.
      * Check if **Project Collection Build Service (your-collection-name)** exists in the list of users.
      * Check if that account has **Create tag** and **Read** access.
  * If the scope is **project**: 
    * Is the repo in the same project as the pipeline?
      * Yes: 
        * This may be an intermittent error. Re-run the pipeline.
        * Someone may have removed the access to **Project Build Service account**.
          * Go to the **project settings** of the project in which the repository exists. Select Repos -> Repositories -> specific repository.
          * Check if **your-project-name Build Service (your-collection-name)** exists in the list of users.
          * Check if that account has **Create tag** and **Read** access.
      * No:
        * Is your pipeline in a public project?
          * Yes: You cannot access resources outside of your public project. Make the project private.
          * No: You need to take additional steps to grant access. Let us say that your pipeline exists in project **A** and that your repository exists in project **B**.
            * Go to the project settings of the project in which the repository exists (B). Select Repos -> Repositories -> specific repository.
            * Add **your-project-name Build Service (your-collection-name)** to the list of users, where your-project-name is the name of the project in which your pipeline exists (A).
            * Give **Create tag** and **Read** access to the account.
