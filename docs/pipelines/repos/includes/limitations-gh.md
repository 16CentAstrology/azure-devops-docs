* For best performance, we recommend a maximum of 50 pipelines in a single repository. For acceptable performance, we recommend a maximum of 100 pipelines in a single repository. The time required to process a push to a repository increases with the number of pipelines in that repository. Whenever there's push to a repository, Azure Pipelines needs to load all YAML pipelines in that repository to figure out if any of them need to run, and each loaded pipeline incurs a performance penalty.
* The use of _extends_ and _include_ templates in a pipeline impacts the rate at which Azure Pipelines makes GitHub API requests and can lead to throttling on GitHub's side. Before running a pipeline, Azure Pipelines needs to generate the complete YAML code. For every commit, Azure Pipelines needs to make multiple calls to GitHub, to update bookkeeping information and information about various types of triggers.
* Azure Pipelines loads a maximum of 2000 branches from a repository into dropdown lists in the Azure Devops Portal, for example into the **Default branch for manual and scheduled builds** setting, or when choosing a branch when running a pipeline manually. If you don't see your desired branch in the list, type the desired branch name manually.
