* For best performance, we recommend there be fewer than 50 pipelines in a single repository. For acceptable performance, there should not be more than 100 pipelines in a single repository. The more pipelines there are, the slower the processing of a push to that repository. This is because, whenever there is push to a repository, Azure Pipelines needs to load all YAML pipelines in that repository, to figure out if any of them need to run. So, each new pipeline incurs a performance penalty.
* Azure Pipelines loads a maximum of 2000 branches from a repository.
