# Publish Pipeline Artifacts

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)]

Azure Artifacts enable developers to store and manage their packages and control who they want to share it with. Pipeline Artifacts are generated after you build your application. The output can then be deployed or consumed by another job in your pipeline.

## Publish Artifacts

You can use [PublishPipelineArtifact@1](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/publish-pipeline-artifact-v1) to publish your pipeline artifact at any stage using either YAML or Classic pipelines, with no charges for storing your pipeline artifacts or using pipeline caching.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

```yaml
- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
  inputs:
    targetPath: '$(Pipeline.Workspace)'
    publishLocation: 'pipeline'
    artifact: 'drop'
```

- **targetPath**: (Required) The path of the file or directory to publish. Can be absolute or relative to the default working directory. Can include [variables](./build/variables.md), but wildcards are not supported. Default value: $(Pipeline.Workspace).

- **publishLocation**: (Required). Artifacts publish location: choose whether to store the artifact in Azure Pipelines, or to copy it to a file share that must be accessible from the pipeline agent. Options: pipeline, filepath. Default value: pipeline.

- **artifact**: (Optional) Name of the artifact to publish. If not set, defaults to a unique ID scoped to the job.

# [Classic](#tab/classic)

1. From your pipeline definition, select + to add a new task.

1. Search for the **Publish Pipeline Artifacts** task :::image type="icon" source="../tasks/utility/media/publish-pipeline-artifact.png" border="false"::: and then select **Add** to add it to your pipeline.

1. Fill out the following fields:
    - **Display name**: the task display name.
    - **File or directory path**: the path of the file or directory to publish.
    - **Artifact name**: name of the Artifact to publish.
    - **Artifact publish location**: choose whether to store the Artifact in Azure Pipelines, or to copy it to a file share.

## Publish Artifacts from the command line

If you want to manually publish your Artifact, run the following command in an elevated command prompt:

```azurecli
az pipelines runs artifact upload --artifact-name your_artifact_name --path your_path_to_publish --run-id '<artifact_run_id>'
```

::: moniker-end

1. Select your pipeline run, and then select the **Summary** tab.

1. Select the published Artifact in the related section.
