## Agent variables (DevOps Server 2020)

> [!NOTE]
> You can use agent variables as environment variables in your scripts and as parameters in your build tasks.
> You cannot use them to customize the build number or to apply a version control label or tag.

| Variable | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| Agent.BuildDirectory | The local path on the agent where all folders for a given build pipeline are created. This variable has the same value as `Pipeline.Workspace`. For example: `/home/vsts/work/1`. |
| Agent.HomeDirectory | The directory the agent is installed into. This contains the agent software. For example: `c:\agent`. |
| Agent.Id | The ID of the agent. |
| Agent.JobName | The name of the running job. This will usually be "Job" or "__default", but in multi-config scenarios, will be the configuration. |
| Agent.JobStatus | The status of the build.<br>    <ul>        <li>`Canceled`        <li>`Failed`        <li>`Succeeded`        <li>`SucceededWithIssues` (partially successful)    </ul><br>The environment variable should be referenced as `AGENT_JOBSTATUS`. The older `agent.jobstatus` is available for backwards compatibility. |
| Agent.MachineName | The name of the machine on which the agent is installed. |
| Agent.Name | The name of the agent that is registered with the pool.<br><br>If you're using a self-hosted agent, then this name gets set by you. See <a href="/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents" data-raw-source="[agents](../../agents/agents.md)">agents</a>. |
| Agent.OS | The operating system of the agent host. Valid values are:<br><ul><li>`Windows_NT`<li>`Darwin`<li>`Linux`</ul><br>If you're running in a container, the agent host and container may be running different operating systems. |
| Agent.OSArchitecture | The operating system processor architecture of the agent host. Valid values are:<br><ul><li>`X86`<li>`X64`<li>`ARM processor`</ul> |
| Agent.TempDirectory | A temporary folder that is cleaned after each pipeline job. This directory is used by tasks such as <a href="/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/dotnet-core-cli-v2">.NET Core CLI task</a> to hold temporary items like test results before they're published.<br>For example: `/home/vsts/work/_temp` for Ubuntu. |
| Agent.ToolsDirectory | The directory used by tasks such as <a href="/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/node-tool-v0" data-raw-source="[Node Tool Installer](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/node-tool-v0)">Node Tool Installer</a> and <a href="/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/use-python-version-v0" data-raw-source="[Use Python Version](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/use-python-version-v0)">Use Python Version</a> to switch between multiple versions of a tool.<br><br>These tasks add tools from this directory to `PATH` so that subsequent build steps can use them.<br><br>Learn about <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2008884" data-raw-source="[managing this directory on a self-hosted agent](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2008884)">managing this directory on a self-hosted agent</a>. |
| Agent.WorkFolder | The working directory for this agent. For example: `c:\agent_work`.<br><br>
Note: This directory isn't guaranteed to be writable by pipeline tasks (for example, when mapped into a container) |

| Build.SourcesDirectory | The local path on the agent where your source code files are downloaded. For example: `c:\agent_work\1\s`<br><br>By default, new build pipelines update only the changed files.<br><br>
Important note: If you check out only one Git repository, this path is the exact path to the code. If you check out multiple repositories, it reverts to its default value, which is `$(Pipeline.Workspace)/s`, even if the self (primary) repository is checked out to a custom path different from its multi-checkout default path `$(Pipeline.Workspace)/s/<RepoName>` (in this respect, the variable differs from the behavior of the Build.Repository.LocalPath variable).<br><br>This variable is agent-scoped, and can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task, but not as part of the build number or as a version control tag. | No |

| Build.StagingDirectory | The local path on the agent where any artifacts are copied to before being pushed to their destination. For example: `c:\agent_work\1\a`.<br><br>A typical way to use this folder is to publish your build artifacts with the <a href="/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/copy-files-v2" data-raw-source="[Copy files](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/copy-files-v2)">Copy files</a> and <a href="/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/publish-build-artifacts-v1" data-raw-source="[Publish build artifacts](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/publish-build-artifacts-v1)">Publish build artifacts</a> tasks.<br><br>Note: Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory and Build.StagingDirectory are interchangeable.

| Build.Repository.Git.SubmoduleCheckout | The value you've selected for **Checkout submodules** on the <a href="/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/index" data-raw-source="[repository tab](../repos/index.md)">repository tab</a>. With multiple repos checked out, this value tracks the triggering repository's setting.<br><br>This variable is agent-scoped, and can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task, but not as part of the build number or as a version control tag. | No |
| Build.SourceTfvcShelveset | Defined if your <a href="/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/index" data-raw-source="[repository](../repos/index.md)">repository</a> is Team Foundation Version Control.<br><br>If you're running a <a href="/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/tfvc#gated" data-raw-source="[gated build](../../repos/tfvc.md#gated)">gated build</a> or a <a href="/azure/devops/pipelines/create-first-pipeline#queueabuild" data-raw-source="[shelveset build](../../create-first-pipeline.md#queueabuild)">shelveset build</a>, this is set to the name of the <a href="/azure/devops/repos/tfvc/suspend-your-work-manage-your-shelvesets" data-raw-source="[shelveset](../../../repos/tfvc/suspend-your-work-manage-your-shelvesets.md)">shelveset</a> you're building.<br><br>
Note: This variable yields a value that is invalid for build use in a build number format. | No |
| Build.TriggeredBy.BuildId | If the build was <a href="/azure/devops/pipelines/process/pipeline-triggers" data-raw-source="[triggered by another build](../../process/pipeline-triggers.md)">triggered by another build</a>, then this variable is set to the BuildID of the triggering build.

| System.DefinitionId | The ID of the build pipeline. | Yes |
| System.HostType | Set to `build` if the pipeline is a build. For a release, the values are `deployment` for a Deployment group job, `gates` during evaluation of gates, and `release` for other (Agent and Agentless) jobs. | Yes |
