# Azure Pipelines agents support

Agents are widely backward compatible. Any version of the agent should be compatible with any Azure DevOps version as long as Azure DevOps isn't demanding a higher version of the agent.

We only support the most recent version of the agent since that is the only version guaranteed to have all up-to-date patches and bug fixes.
