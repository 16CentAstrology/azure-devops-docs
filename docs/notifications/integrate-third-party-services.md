# Integrate third-party services

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-tfs-2017-on](../_shared/version-tfs-2017-through-vsts.md)]

> [!NOTE]  
> This article applies to Azure DevOps, TFS 2017 Update 1, and later versions. If you work from an on-premises TFS 2017 or earlier versions, see [Set alerts, get notified when changes occur](../work/track/alerts-and-notifications.md). For on-premises TFS, [you must configure an SMTP server](/../../server/admin/setup-customize-alerts) for team members to see the Notifications option from their organization menu and to receive notifications.

Integrate with your favorite services by notifying them when events happen in Azure DevOps. See the following examples:

* [Send Azure DevOps notifications to a Slack channel](../service-hooks/services/slack.md)
* [Send Azure DevOps notifications to a Microsoft Teams channel](../service-hooks/services/teams.md)
* [Send Azure DevOps notifications to a Trello board](../service-hooks/services/trello.md)
* [Send Azure DevOps notifications to a HipChat room](../service-hooks/services/hipchat.md)
* [Send Azure DevOps notifications to Azure Service Bus](../service-hooks/services/azure-service-bus.md)

Or, integrate with any endpoint by [Sending Azure DevOps notifications to a generic WebHook](../service-hooks/services/webhooks.md). [Learn about all the integration options](../service-hooks/index.md).
