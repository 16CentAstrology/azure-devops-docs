# Change your preferred email address for notifications

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-ts-tfs-2015-2016.md)]

This is typically the email address you signed into Azure DevOps Services or Team Foundation Server (TFS) with.

> Your preferred email address applies across all of your organizations and can't be changed on a per-organization basis.
