### Resolve images that don't display in Team Explorer 

If an inline image isn't displayed in a work item form that you view in Visual Studio Team Explorer, but the image is displayed in the web portal, your credentials might have expired. You can resolve this by completing the following steps:  

1. In Visual Studio, select **View** > **Other Windows** > **Web Browser** (or use the shortcut **Ctrl+Alt+R**).   
1. In the web browser, locate your Azure DevOps organization.  
1. Sign in with your credentials.  
1. Refresh your work item in Team Explorer.
