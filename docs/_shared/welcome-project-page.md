> [!NOTE]   
> Your first project was created with a Git repository and the [Agile process](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process). If you want a project that uses the TVFC repository or the Scrum or CMMI process (see [Choose a process](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/choose-process) for a comparison of processes), then you can do so by [adding another project](/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project). 

Choose one of the following to get started:  
- **Invite** to begin [adding others to your project](/azure/devops/organizations/security/add-users-team-project). Note, you can only invite users who have already been [added to your organization](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/add-team-members-vs). 
- Choose **Azure Boards** to begin [adding work items](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/view-add-work-items).
- Choose **Azure Repos** to open [Repos>Files](/azure/devops/repos/git/clone) page where you can clone or import a repository, or [initialize a README file](/azure/devops/project/wiki/project-vision-status) for your project summary page.
- Choose **Azure Pipelines** to start [defining a pipeline](/azure/devops/pipelines/index).
- Choose **Azure Test Plans** to start [defining test plans and test suites](/azure/devops/test/create-a-test-plan).
- Choose [Manage your services](/azure/devops/settings/set-services) to disable the visibility of one or more services.

To get started managing your project, see [Get started as an administrator](/azure/devops/user-guide/project-admin-tutorial).
