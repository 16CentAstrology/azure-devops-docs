## Sign up for Azure DevOps with a GitHub account

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your GitHub email address is associated with an Azure AD-backed organization in Azure DevOps, you can't sign in with your GitHub account, rather you must sign in with your Azure AD account.

1. From the [Azure DevOps](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=307137) site, select **Start free with GitHub**. If you're already part of an Azure DevOps organization, select **Sign in to Azure DevOps**.

3. Enter your GitHub account credentials, and then select **Sign in**.
