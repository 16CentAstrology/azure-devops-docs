# Traceability, automation, and process improvement 


Agile methods are built on the following four main values:   

> [!div class="checklist"]  
> - Individuals & interactions over processes & tools
> - Working software over comprehensive documentation
> - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> - Responding to change over following a plan




Agile teams have characteristics including, but not limited to the following

Faster release cycles
Continuous testing in a pipeline
Negligible manual testing footprint; limited to exploratory testing
High degree of automation

Continuous delivery of value. 
Automation. Minimize errors. 

Goals 
- Highlight the advantages of the integration across Azure DevOps Services to support traceability 
- Address both standard product features as well as useful Marketplace extensions and customization options to deliver a comprehensive solution
- Increase page views to Azure DevOps by including industry-specific terms captured through SEO 
- Highlight how Microsoft uses our tools to meet our DevOps needs. 
- Use industry terms liberally to drive SEO 
- Consider linking to GitHub content where appropriate 
- Link to templates, code samples that help implement select scenarios   


## Best practices

Prioritize enabling the team over providing oversight.

-  Implement whole pieces of functionality instead of one layer at a time.
-  Testers work as part of the development team.
-  Perform frequent customer demonstrations.
-  Perform retrospectives for process improvement.
-  Automate deployments to all environments.
-  Consider a reactive  architecture
-  Develop in short iterations that result in high quality software at the end of each iteration.
