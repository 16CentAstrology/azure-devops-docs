We **strongly recommend** you use the [!INCLUDE [test-hub-include-nolink](../_shared/test-hub-include-nolink.md)] (a fully featured Test management solution) over Microsoft Test Manager for all your test management requirements. **There will be no new versions of Microsoft Test Manager.** Microsoft Test Manager 2017 (which shipped with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017) is the last version.
