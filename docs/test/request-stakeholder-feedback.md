# Request stakeholder feedback using the Test & Feedback extension

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

## Request feedback from stakeholders

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Request feedback** shortcut menu is no longer available in the Azure DevOps service. However, there are alternative ways to request feedback, such as through email and chat, in addition to utilizing the [Test & Feedback extension](./voluntary-stakeholder-feedback.md).

Request feedback from stakeholders directly from an Azure DevOps work item. 

1. Open the work item form for the user story or feature for which
   you want to request feedback.

2. Open the shortcut menu from the ellipses (**...**) and select **Request feedback**.

3. Enter or select the names of the stakeholder(s) you want to send the request to, and optionally add any instructions or notes that help them provide meaningful feedback.

4. Select **Send** to generate emails to the selected stakeholders.

Teams can request feedback from other team members, such as users having Basic access. Just add their names in the feedback request form so that a **Request feedback** email gets sent to them. Also see [Can users with Basic access respond to feedback requests](provide-stakeholder-feedback.md#non-stakeholder-feedback).
