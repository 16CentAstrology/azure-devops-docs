# Explore work items with the Test & Feedback extension

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Use the Test & Feedback extension to explore existing work items and 
associate them with a new or an in-progress exploratory session. 
After a work item is associated with a session, all new bugs, tasks and test cases created 
in the current session are automatically linked to that work item, which enables end-to-end traceability, and simplifies tracking and management of issues.

Explore the following items:
- Work items belonging to a requirement category, a feature category, or an epic category and requirements-based test suites and test cases
- A work item from the [Kanban board](#kanban) or from the [extension](#extension)
- [Multiple work items in the same session](#multipleitems)

[!INCLUDE [prerequisites-define](includes/prerequisites-stakeholder.md)]

2. Associate the new work item with the in-progress session as [previously described](#extension).

## See your exploratory session results 

After you file bugs, create tasks, or create test cases, they show up in the "Recent exploratory sessions" page in Azure Test Plans.
