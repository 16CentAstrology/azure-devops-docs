# Workplace Messaging Apps 

The following integrations help users to receive notifications in response to events in Azure DevOps within their workplace messaging apps like 
[Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) and [Slack](https://slack.com). 


## Azure DevOps Services
These integrations also help users to complete workflows on Azure DevOps, such as allowing users to approve release deployments and creating work items from their channels. You can use these apps only with a project hosted on Azure DevOps Services at this time.
