# Project summary 

[!INCLUDE [version-all](../../includes/version-all.md)]  

Each project provides a Summary page which you can edit to support your team(s) to understand the purpose of your project. Use this page to support the following tasks:

- Provide links for details on how to contribute 
- Indicate who project members should contact to elevate permissions, access, or other requests 
- Invite people to contribute to your project 


## Prerequisites

- To view the project Summary page, you must be a member of the project. 
- To edit the project Summary page, you must be a member of the Project Administrators group. 
 
## Suggested information to provide


## Update the project description and home page

The **Summary** page displays either the **README** file defined in a project repository or the home page of a project wiki. If you want to use the project wiki home page, first set that up as described in [Create a Wiki for your project](../../project/wiki/wiki-create-repo.md).

1. To edit the **Summary** page:

	- If it is the first time editing the page, choose Add Project Description. 
		:::image type="content" source="media/summary/add-project-description.png" alt-text="Screenshot of summary page, first time editing.":::

	- If editing the page after it's been set up, choose the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/edit.png" border="false"::: **Edit project information**.
 
1. Provide a brief description of the project purpose in the **Description** box.  

		:::image type="content" source="media/summary/about-this-project-dialog.png" alt-text="About this project dialog.":::

1. Optionally add one or more **Tags** for your project. These tags are similar to [work item tags](../../boards/queries/add-tags-to-work-items.md). 

1. Choose whether to reference a **README** file or the project wiki home page for the rest of the Summary page contents.  

	If choosing a **Readme file**, select the repository for the README. A preview of the current text for the README file is shown. 

	:::image type="content" source="media/summary/select-readme-repository.png" alt-text="About this project dialog, choose and select README repository.":::

	> [!TIP] 
	> A default README is created within the repository added when you created your project. You can choose this README or create another repository and README file for this purpose.
