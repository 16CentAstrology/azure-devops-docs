# Add a user to manage billing

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Classic admins retire August 31, 2024. Starting on February 26, you can't add a new co-administrator using the Access control blade. Remove co-administrators and use Azure RBAC for fine-grained access control. For more information, see [Azure classic subscription administrators](/azure/role-based-access-control/classic-administrators).

Give another user access, so they can [set up billing](set-up-billing-for-your-organization-vs.md) or [change the Azure subscription used for billing](change-azure-subscription.md) for your Azure DevOps organization. 

Assign any of the following roles to a user under the subscription your organization uses for billing: [Owner](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner), [Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor), [Service admin](/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator), and [Co-admin](/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator). For more information, see [Azure roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles).
