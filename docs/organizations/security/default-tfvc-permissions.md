# Default TFVC permissions

[!INCLUDE [version-all](../../includes/version-all.md)]

Once you have been added as a team member, you are a member of the Contributors group. This allows you to contribute to a TFVC repository. The most common built-in groups include Readers, Contributors, and Project Administrators. These groups are assigned the default permissions for contributing to the repository as listed below.
 

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/code-tfvc.md)]

To change permissions for TFVC repositories or branches, see [Set TFVC repository permissions](../../repos/tfvc/set-tfvc-repository-permissions.md).
