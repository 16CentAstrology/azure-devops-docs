> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you regularly review the rules listed on the "Group rules" tab of the "Users" page. If any changes get made to the Active Directory (AD) group membership, these changes show up in the next re-evaluation of the group rules, which can be done on-demand, when a group rule gets modified, or automatically every 24 hours. Azure DevOps updates Microsoft Entra group membership every hour, but it may take up to 24 hours for Microsoft Entra ID to update [dynamic group membership](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-dynamic-membership).
