CSS team - request from a customer 
relationship through test run adn user story - is related; 

- parent relationship 
- 
- Process model impact 
- Managing technical debt vs addressing bugs that arise during a sprint 
- Can create a custom bug to manage along with requirements AND use a bug work item type to manage along with tasks
