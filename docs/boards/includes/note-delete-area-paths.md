> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Deleting **Area Paths** or reconfiguring **Iteration Paths** causes irreversible data loss. For example, burndown and burnup widget charts, sprint burndown, and velocity charts for teams with changed **Area Paths** don't show accurate data. Historical trend charts reference the **Area Path** and **Iteration Path** as defined at the time for each work item. Once deleted, historical data for these paths can't be retrieved.
