The default set of backlog work items which support a natural hierarchical grouping varies depending on the process chosen for your project. The easiest way to group work items into a hierarchy is by mapping them, or adding them to the parent item on a Kanban board. To learn more, see [Organize your backlog, map child work items to parents](/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/organize-backlog#map-items-to-group-them-under-a-feature-or-epic) and [Kanban board features and epics](/azure/devops/boards/boards/kanban-epics-features-stories).
