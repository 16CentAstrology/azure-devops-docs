> [!NOTE] 
> Work items are subject to rules applied to them. Conditional rules based on user or group membership are cached for your web browser. If you find yourself restricted to update a work item, you may have encountered one of these rules. If you believe you've encountered an issue that doesn't apply to you, see [Work item form IndexDB caching issues](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/work/work-item-form-caching). To learn more about conditional rules, see [Add a rule to a work item type (Inheritance process)](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/work/custom-rules.md) or [Apply or ignore rules based on user or group (On-premises XML process](/azure/devops/reference/xml/apply-rule-work-item-field#apply-or-ignore-rules-based-on-user-or-group).
