> Work items that appear on more than one team's Kanban board can yield results that don't meet your expectations because each team can customize their Kanban board columns and swimlanes. The values assigned to Kanban **Board Column**, **Board Column Done**, and **Board Lane** fields may differ from what you expect when another team updates the work item from a different board. To learn more, see [Configure a hierarchy of teams, Exercising select features with shared area paths](../plans/configure-hierarchical-teams.md#op-issues).
