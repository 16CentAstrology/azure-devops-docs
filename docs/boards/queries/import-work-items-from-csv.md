# Import & update bulk work items with CSV files

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2019](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2019.md)]

::: moniker range="> azure-devops-2019"
Import and export work items in bulk using a CSV formatted file in Azure DevOps. While you can continue to use Excel for bulk import and updates, you can use the native import/export feature that doesn't require Excel. For more information, see [Bulk add or modify work items with Excel](../backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md).

You can export of work items in bulk using a CSV formatted file. While you continue to use Excel for bulk import and updates, you can use the native export feature from Queries that doesn't require Excel. For more information, see [Bulk add or modify work items with Excel](../backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md).

## Import new work items

Do the following steps to import new work items.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can import up to 1,000 work items at a time. If you have more than 1,000 work items to import, break them into multiple files and import them separately. 

1. Create a local ***import.csv*** file and open it in Visual Studio Code or Excel.
2. The file must contain the **Work Item Type** and the **Title** fields. You can include other fields as needed. For a list of default fields, see [Work item field index](../work-items/guidance/work-item-field.md).  

	In the following example, we include the **Priority** field.

   > [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
   ```CSV
   Work Item Type,Title,Priority
   Issue,Fix issues with code,1
   Issue,Merge testing modules,3
   Issue,Open private preview for select customers,2
   Issue,Enable feature for customer champs,2
   Issue,Remove old test code,2
   ```

3. From the web portal for your project, open **Boards** > **Queries**, and then select **Import work items**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/import-csv/open-queries-import.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Boards - Queries, Import Work Items.":::

4. Select **Choose file**, choose your file, and then select **Import**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/import-csv/import-file.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Import Work Items Button Image.":::

   The import process loads the imported work items into the queries view in an **unsaved** state. No IDs get assigned. 
   
5. Verify the results and then select **Save items** to save the work items.

   :::image type="content" source="media/import-csv/imported-file.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Save button for imported work items.":::

	> [!TIP]  
	> Avoid assigning IDs to new work items youâ€™re adding; doing so results in an error message.

6. The system highlights those work items with data issues. Resolve the data issues before you save the work items. In this example, an invalid value is in the Priority field. Fix the data by opening the work item directly. Instead, use [bulk edit](../backlogs/bulk-modify-work-items.md) to fix several work items with the same issue.

   :::image type="content" source="media/import-csv/imported-file-error.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing fix work items with data issues.":::

### Tips

- **Parent-child links:** You can add parent-child links between work items you import by indenting the title columns, as shown in [Can I import a CSV file that have parent-child links?](#tree-items). However, you can't specify any other link types when importing or updating work items.
- **Default State field:** When you import new work items, the "State" field is always set to "New" by default. You can't specify a different state during the import process. If you need to change the state of imported work items, you can use the following workaround:
    1. Import the work items with the default "New" state.
    2. Export the imported work items to a CSV file.
    3. Update the "State" field values in the exported CSV file.
    4. Reimport the updated CSV file to set the desired states.
- **Default Area and Iteration fields:** The "Area" and "Iteration" fields default to the top-level node. This behavior occurs because the import process doesn't have the context for these fields unless explicitly specified in the CSV file. To set specific "Area" and "Iteration" paths during import, ensure these fields are included in your CSV file with the correct values. For example:
    ```csv
    Title,Description,Area Path,Iteration Path
    "Sample Work Item","This is a sample description.","Project\Team","Project\Sprint 1"
    ```

## Update existing work items

1. To update work items, create a query that contains all the columns you want to export and possibly edit. Save your query and select **Export to CSV** to save the data.csv file to your local machine.

   :::image type="content" source="media/import-csv/export-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing export work items, CSV.":::

	The exported file should look similar to the following syntax:

	> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
	```CSV
	ID,Work Item Type,State,Assigned To,Title,Tags
	"1043","Issue","To Do",,"Fix issues with code",
	"1044","Issue","To Do",,"Merge testing modules",
	"1045","Issue","To Do",,"Open private preview for select customers",
	"1046","Issue","To Do",,"Enable feature for customer champs",
	"1047","Issue","To Do",,"Remove old test code",
	```

2. Make the edits to your work items. Your CSV file must contain the **ID**, **Work Item Type**, **Title**, and **State** fields. Any other fields you want to include are optional.

   > [!NOTE]   
   > When you import identity fields, enter the name and email in the following format `"Display Name <email>"`. For example, to assign work to Jamal Hartnett, specify `"Jamal Hartnett <fabrikamfiber4@hotmail.com>"`. If you specify a value that isn't recognized as a valid user to the system, you may encounter problems with the import. 

   In the following example, we change several values on existing working items.

   ```ID,Work Item Type,State,Assigned To,Title,Tags
   "1043","Issue","To Do","Jamal Hartnett <fabrikamfiber4@hotmail.com>","Fix issues with code",architecture
   "1044","Issue","To Do","Jamal Hartnett <fabrikamfiber4@hotmail.com>","Merge testing modules",testing
   "1045","Issue","To Do","Raisa Pokrovskaya <fabrikamfiber5@hotmail.com>","Open private preview for select customers","customer focus"
   "1046","Issue","To Do","Raisa Pokrovskaya <fabrikamfiber5@hotmail.com>","Enable feature for customer champs","customer focus"
   "1047","Issue","To Do","Christie Church <fabrikamfiber1@hotmail.com>","Remove old test code",architecture```

3. Save the file and import (see steps 4-6 from the previous [import section](#import-new-work-items).)

4. The results list with work items that contain value changes appear highlighted in bold. Select **Save Items** to apply the changes.

   :::image type="content" source="media/import-csv/bulk-update-import.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Import Work Items, Save Items.":::

5. Work items with data issues get highlighted in red and must be resolved before you can save them. In this example, an invalid value appears in the Assigned To field. Fix the data by opening the work item directly. You can use bulk edit if you have many work items with the same issue.

   :::image type="content" source="media/import-csv/import-update-error-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Invalid value appearing in the Assigned To field.":::

## Export list as a CSV file

From any query, you can export a list of work items as a comma-delimited list. [Open the query](view-run-query.md), select the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: actions icon, and then select **Export to CSV**.

## Export and import work items to a different project

You can use this feature to export work items from one project and import them to another project. However, before you import them to another project, you must remove the work item ID. You get an error if you attempt to import new work items to a project with an ID specified.

## Import HTML fields 

HTML fields, such as descriptions and acceptance criteria, include rich text formatting. To ensure this formatting is preserved, do the following tasks:

1. Ensure your CSV file includes HTML tags within the relevant fields.
2. Import the CSV file into Excel.

Excel might handle multi-line text fields differently, so it's important to check the formatting after import. Replace lines ending in `CRLF` by surrounding sentences with `<p>... </p>`. 

For example, you can import the following work item, which includes three lines of text in the Description field. 

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
```CSV
Work Item Type,Title,Description
"Product Backlog Item","Hello World Web Site - 8","<p><strong>&nbsp;You can include bold text</strong></p><p><em>&nbsp;And italic text</em></p><p><u>&nbsp;Underline text</u></p>"
```

## Convert multi-line fields to plaintext

To disable HTML in multi-line fields to ensure they're plaintext, you can use the `witadmin changefield` command. For detailed steps, see [Manage Work Item Fields](../../reference/witadmin/manage-work-item-fields.md).

Example command:
```shell
witadmin changefield /collection:CollectionURL /n:FieldName /type:PlainText
```

## Handle formatting inconsistencies

When you work with HTML fields across different Microsoft products, you might encounter formatting inconsistencies. Here are some tips to handle these issues:

- Review the formatting post-import to ensure it meets your requirements.
- Use appropriate HTML tags and structures to minimize discrepancies. You can add multiple tags separated by a semicolon. For more information, see [Tasks you can and can't do with Excel](../backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md).

For more information on managing HTML content and ensuring compatibility, see the [official documentation on HTML content in Azure DevOps](../../reference/xml/provide-help-text-hyperlinks-web-content-form.md).

## FAQs

### Q: Can I import new items and update existing items in the same CSV file?

A: Absolutely! Leave the ID field empty for any new work items. In the following example, the last entry for an Epic doesn't specify an ID.

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
```CSV
ID,Work Item Type,Title,Assigned To,State,Priority,Tags
"16504","Issue","Fix issues with code",,"To Do","1",
"16505","Issue","Merge testing modules",,"To Do","3",
"16506","Issue","Open private preview for select customers",,"To Do","2",
"16507","Issue","Enable feature for customer champs",,"To Do","2",
"16508","Issue","Remove old test code",,"To Do","2",
,"Epic","Track Telemetry for data imports",,"To Do","2",
```

<a id="tree-items"></a> 

### Q: Can I import a CSV file that has parent-child links?

A: Yes, you can add child work items by indenting title columns. The following example adds three child issues under the already defined Epic.

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
```CSV
ID,Work Item Type,Title 1,Title 2,Assigned To,State,Priority,Tags
"165","Epic","Track Telemetry for data imports",,,"To Do","2",
,"Issue",,"Fix issues with code",,"To Do","1",
,"Issue",,"Open private preview for select customers",,"To Do","2",
,"Issue",,"Enable feature for customer champs",,"To Do","2",
```

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot showing Excel view.](media/import-csv/import-add-child-items.png)

### Q: How do I know if my imported file has errors?

A: You can test by adding tags with spaces and hyphens, for example, and include it in the export. The import should match the same format. Any problems with the formatting of your CSV file appear in the Results page of the import view. You can't import the work items until the formatting and syntax is correct.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of CSV Error.](media/import-csv/import-error.png)

The work item results always list the data errors found for individual work items. Fix each error either from the web portal, or in the CSV file and import again.

### Q: Why am I getting errors for some identity values?

A: When you use the Web UI, the identity picker goes through extra steps to validate the user. First it checks to see if the person is a valid user in the org. If not, it searches on the identity in Microsoft Entra ID. If the user's in Microsoft Entra ID but not in the org, that user gets added to the valid identities. When you import via CSV, for performance reasons, the identity picker doesn't go through these extra steps. It only checks to see if there's a matching UPN already in the org. If it doesn't find a matching UPN, it reports that the identity is unknown.

### Q: Does CSV import support all work item types?

A: No, the CSV import doesn't support the following work item types:

- Code Review Request
- Code Review Response
- Feedback Request
- Feedback Response
- Test Case
- Test Plan
- Test Suite
- Shared Parameter

For more information, see [Bulk import or export test cases](../../test/copy-clone-test-items.md).
