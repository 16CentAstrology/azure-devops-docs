## WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)

We recommend using the [WSJF extension by Microsoft DevLabs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-Agile-SAFe.WSJF-extension) to compute and store WSJF for your SAFe速 deliverables. 
 
SAFe速 defines WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First) as a calculation of cost of delay versus job size. This value can help teams prioritize their portfolio backlogs with the items contributing the highest ROI.

![WSJF = (Business Value + Time Criticality - Risk Reduction | Opportunity Enablement Value)/Job Size](media/safe/wsjf.png) 

Four values are used to calculate WSJF:

- Business Value
- Time Criticality
- Risk Reduction | Opportunity Enablement Value
- Job Size

For details on adding and managing the extension, see the [WSJF extension overview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-Agile-SAFe.WSJF-extension).
