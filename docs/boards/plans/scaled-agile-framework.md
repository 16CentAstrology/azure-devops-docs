# Implement Scaled Agile Framework&reg; to support epics, release trains, and multiple backlogs  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

As enterprises are benefiting from individual agile teams, the question now is how do we scale these practices across teams and gain a portfolio view of the progress of agile teams throughout the enterprise? To address these needs, many businesses are using the Scaled Agile Framework&reg; (SAFe&reg;). 

If you're familiar with Scrum but not familiar with SAFe, [these videos at Scaled Agile Framework Foundations](http://scaledagileframework.com/foundations) from Inbar Oren, the Lean Samurai, are a good way to orient yourself.  

## The Scaled Agile Framework

The SAFe big picture addresses how a portfolio vision is met by a hierarchy of teams, all concerned with specific objectives. This framework breaks down epics into features and stories, which teams work on in Sprints and deliver through Program Increments (PIs) and Release Trains. Also, the portfolio backlog can track how deliverables map to value streams and associated budgets.

## Azure Boards, Agile tools and SAFe support 

If you're interested in using SAFe, you can configure projects created with the [Scrum](../work-items/guidance/scrum-process.md), [Agile](../work-items/guidance/agile-process.md), or [CMMI](../work-items/guidance/cmmi-process.md) processes to track SAFe criteria. Moreover, just as Azure Boards supports Scrum and Agile practices, it can support SAFe and large numbers of teams to work together on epics that span releases. 

The following image illustrates how you can configure Azure Boards to support a three-level team hierarchy and map teams to their respective area and iteration paths. The examples build from the [Agile process](../work-items/guidance/agile-process.md), However, the changes can be applied to any project and process hosted on Azure Boards.
