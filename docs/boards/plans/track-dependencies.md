# Track dependencies using Delivery Plans 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/version-all.md)] 


<a id="dependencies">  </a>

## Show dependency lines for a work item 

## Open the dependency summary for a work item 

## Identify dependency issues 

To view dependencies for a work item, hover over the upper-right corner and choose the dependency-links :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/dependency-links.png" border="false"::: icon. 

For example, here we show a work item with dependencies to several work items within the same project.   

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of dependencies within the same project. ](media/plans/dependencies.png)  

When the dependency is to a work item in another project, the project information is shown as well as other link relationships. A red exclamation mark and red colored arrows indicate there is an issue with the dependency.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of dependencies-cross-project. ](media/plans/dependencies-cross-project.png)
