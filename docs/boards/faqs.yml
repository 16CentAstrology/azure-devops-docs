  - name: Access and permissions 
     
    questions: 

      - question: Who can contribute to Azure Boards? 
        answer: |
          As a member of an Azure Boards project, you can use the majority of features to track work. Limitations to select features are based on the access level and security group to which a user is assigned. Other limitations can be imposed based on work tracking permissions or custom rules. To learn more, see [Default permissions and access for Azure Boards](get-started/permissions-access-boards.md). 

      - question: How can non-contributors view or modify work items?  
        answer: |
          ::: moniker range="azure-devops"
          For private projects, you can grant access to an unlimited number of users by assigning them Stakeholder access. For public projects, anonymous users&mdash;ones who don't sign into the project&mdash;can view all work items. To learn more, see [About access levels](../organizations/security/access-levels.md) and [About public projects](../organizations/public/about-public-projects.md).   
          Also, if your organization uses Azure Active Directory to manage user access, you can [add external users to your organization](../organizations/accounts/add-external-user.md).
          ::: moniker-end

          ::: moniker range="< azure-devops"
          You can grant access to an unlimited number of users by assigning them Stakeholder access. To learn more, see [About access levels](../organizations/security/access-levels.md).
          ::: moniker-end

      - question: How can I restrict viewing or modifying select work items?  
        answer: |
          You can restrict access by setting permissions for an area path. To learn more, see the following articles: 
          - [Set work tracking and plan permissions](../organizations/security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md?toc=/azure/devops/boards/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/boards/breadcrumb/toc.json)
          - [Grant or restrict permissions to select tasks](../organizations/security/restrict-access.md?toc=/azure/devops/boards/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/boards/breadcrumb/toc.json) 

      - question: What client tools support work tracking with Azure Boards? 
        answer: |
          See [Tools and clients that connect to Azure DevOps](../user-guide/tools.md).

  - name: Work items and templates |

    questions: 
      - question: Where should I start to learn about work items and templates? 

        answer: |
          For an introduction to work items, see [About work items](work-items/about-work-items.md). To define work item templates to specify defaults for select fields, see [Use templates to add and update work items](backlogs/work-item-template.md).

      - question: Can a work item be assigned to several users or a user group? 

        answer: |
          No. Work items can only be assigned to a single user. Also, that user must have been [added to a project or team](../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md).  

      - question: What's the recommended method to group work? 

        answer: |
          The main method to group work is to assign it to the same area path. Area paths are used to group work items by product, feature, or business areas and to support teams responsible for work assigned to those areas. In addition, you can group work under a parent work item using parent-child links, referred to as a hierarchical grouping. 

          For a discussion of these two usages and the tools they support, see [Configuration and customization of Azure Boards, Area paths, product teams, and portfolio management](configure-customize.md#area-path).

      - question: How to mark a task or work item as a milestone task?

        answer: |
          Milestone markers aren't used in Azure Boards work tracking, except for Delivery Plans. Delivery Plans provide a calendar view and allow you to define a milestone marker. For more information, see [Review team Delivery Plans](plans/review-team-plans.md).  

          However, you can use one or more of the following options to mark a work item as a milestone: 
          - Simply prepend or append the word **Milestone** in the title of your work item
          - [Add a work item tag](queries/add-tags-to-work-items.md) labeled **Milestone**   
          - [Add a custom field](../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-field.md) labeled **Milestone** and populate it with a pick list of milestones  
          - [Link work items](backlogs/add-link.md) using the Predecessor/Successor or Related link type to a milestone work item 
          - [Assign the milestone work item to the sprint](sprints/assign-work-sprint.md) in which it's targeted for completion.

      - question: How can I best track dependencies?
        answer: |
          You can track dependencies between work items by linking them using a related or other link type. See [Link work items](backlogs/add-link.md) and [Linking, traceability, and managing dependencies](queries/link-work-items-support-traceability.md). 

          ::: moniker range="azure-devops"
          You can view dependencies using [Delivery Plans (Preview)](plans/review-team-plans.md). Or, use the [Epic Roadmap](extensions/epic-roadmap.md). 
          ::: moniker-end

          If you are tracking dependencies across one or more organizations, you may want to use the [Dependency Tracker](extensions/dependency-tracker.md).

      - question: Can I copy a work item including its subtasks? 

        answer: |
          ::: moniker range="azure-devops"
          Yes. Azure Boards (cloud service) now supports copying child work items when copying a work item. For details, see [Copy or clone work items](backlogs/copy-clone-work-items.md#copy-clone).  
          ::: moniker-end
          ::: moniker range="< azure-devops"
          **No**. Cloning doesn't copy work item subtasks for on-premises deployments. Is this feature on the roadmap? **Yes**. In fact, it has been released on Azure Boards (cloud service).  
          ::: moniker-end

      - question: Can I create a work item template that creates links to other work items?   

        answer: |
          **Example request**: *When creating a template, I would like the Parent User Story to be defaulted. There is not a pre-determined field in the template. Would/could this be under a user-defined selection?*  

          No, there is no native support for creating hierarchy templates. In particular, you can't specify a default parent work item. However, you may find a solution To creating child work items by installing one of the following Marketplace extensions:  
          - [Work item form one click actions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mohitbagra.witoneclickactions)  
          - [1-Click Child-Links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ruifig.vsts-work-item-one-click-child-links)  
          - [1-Click Tasks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ruifig.vsts-work-item-one-click-tasks) 

      - question: How do I copy or clone a work item with all linked items? 

        answer: |
          ::: moniker range="azure-devops"
          With Azure Boards (cloud service), you can choose to copy child work items when copying a work item. For details, see [Copy or clone work items](backlogs/copy-clone-work-items.md#copy-clone).  
          ::: moniker-end

          ::: moniker range="< azure-devops"
          This feature isn't supported at this time for on-premises deployments. Copying a work item doesn't copy any parent-child linked work items. However, is is now available on Azure Boards (cloud service).  

          The easiest way to accomplish the task of copying many work items with child items, is to create parent-child links to new work items using Excel. To learn how, see [Bulk add or modify work items with Excel, Add a hierarchy of linked work items](backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md#import-work-items-tree-list).

          Other solutions include employing one of the following Marketplace extensions:  
          - [Work item form one click actions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mohitbagra.witoneclickactions)  
          - [1-Click Child-Links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ruifig.vsts-work-item-one-click-child-links)  
          - [1-Click Tasks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ruifig.vsts-work-item-one-click-tasks)

  - name: GitHub integration

    questions: 
      - question: How do I connect Azure Boards to GitHub?

        answer: | 
          Azure Boards integrates with GitHub for Auzre DevOps Server 2019 and later versions. To learn more, see [Azure Boards & GitHub](github/index.md).

      - question: Can I specify the status when linking a work item to a GitHub commit or PR?

        answer: | 
          **No**. This feature isn't supported at this time. 

  - name: Backlogs and boards 
    questions: 
      - question: What's the difference between a backlog and a board?  
        answer: | 
          Each backlog and board represents a filtered set of work items based on team area path and iteration path assignments. Backlogs list work items, boards display work items as cards. To understand how the filtering is applied, see [About teams and Agile tools, Team defaults referenced by backlogs and boards](../organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings.md#team-defaults). For details on usage, see [Backlogs, Boards, and Plans](backlogs/backlogs-boards-plans.md).

      - question: How do I add a backlog or board?  
        answer: | 
          To add a backlog or board, you add a team. Each team is configured with it's own set of it's own set of backlogs and boards as described in [About teams and Agile tools](../organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings.md). Each team can customize these Agile tools. 

      - question: How do I migrate my existing backlog to Azure Boards?  
        answer: | 
          See [Azure Boards migration and integration](extensions/migrate-integrate.md).



      - question: How do the three types of backlogs&mdash;product, portfolio, and sprint backlogs&mdash;differ?
        answer: | 
          Each backlog lists a filtered set of work items based on the team's selected area path, iteration paths, and work item types.  
          - **Product backlog**: By default lists User Stories (Agile), Issues (Basic), Product Backlog Items and Bugs (Scrum), or Requirements (CMMI). Provides options to show **Parents**, **Forecast**, and **In Progress** or **Completed** child items.  
          - **Portfolio backlog**: By default lists Features (all process models) for the Features backlog, and Epics (Agile, Scrum, and CMMI) for the Epic backlog. Provides options to show **Parents** and **In Progress** or **Completed** child items. 
          - **Sprint backlog**: By default lists all product backlog items assigned to the selected iteration, regardless of status. Provides options to show **Work details**.   

          To learn more, see [Tasks supported by Backlogs, Boards, Taskboards, and Plans](backlogs/backlogs-boards-plans.md).

      - question: Can I define sprints and use them with my Kanban board? 
        answer: | 
          **Yes**. You can assign sprints to work items and filter your Kanban board based on the iteration path. To learn more, see [Filter your Kanban board](boards/filter-kanban-board.md). 

      - question: How do I create a view of the critical path? 
        answer: | 
          Azure DevOps doesn't provide a native view of the critical path. In part, as Agile methodologies favor a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) over Critical Path Management (CPM). By using MVP, you identify the shortest path and dependencies by prioritizing epics, features, stories and tasks.

          That said, you may find that one or more of the following features supports both CPM and MVP. You gain access to these features by installing a Marketplace extension.
 
          - [Delivery Plans](plans/review-team-plans.md)
          - [Feature Timeline](extensions/feature-timeline.md)  
          - [Dependency Tracker](extensions/dependency-tracker.md)  

          If your organization supports connection to Microsoft Project, you may find additional [Marketplace extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=AzureDevOps&category=Azure%20Boards&sortBy=Relevance) that support connection of Azure DevOps to Microsoft Project.  

          For additional context, see [The Critical Path on Agile Projects](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/the-critical-path-on-agile-projects) and [Running a lean startup on Azure DevOps](https://medium.com/@giladkhen/running-a-lean-startup-on-azure-devops-5934ced2cc42).

  - name: Configuration and customizations 
    questions: 
      - question: What is configurable or customizable? 
        answer: | 
          Configuration and customization of Azure Boards occurs at the project and team level. For an overview of what you can configure and customize to support your business needs, see [Configuration and customization of Azure Boards](configure-customize.md). 

      - question: How do I change the picklist of values? 
        answer: | 
          Picklist value entries are dependent on the data type. Refer to the following articles based on the field type of interest:  
          - **Numeric or string picklist fields**: You can customize the menu values for fields such as [Priority](boards/queries/planning-ranking-priorities.md), [Activity](boards/queries/query-numeric.md), [Discipline](boards/queries/query-numeric.md), and so on. See [Add and manage fields (Inherited process)](../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-field.md) or [Add or modify a field, customize a picklist (On-premises XML process)](../reference/add-modify-field.md).  
          - **Area Path or Iteration Path**: These tree-path fields are configured for each project. To learn more, see [About area and iteration (sprint) paths](../organizations/settings/about-areas-iterations.md).  
          - **Person-name or Identity fields**: To add values for fields associated with user accounts such as Assigned To, [add users to a project security group or a team](../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md). By default, the list for these fields contain the account names for all users and groups that have been added to your organization or on-premises collection. These accounts are often synchronized with Active Directory or Azure Active Directory. See [Add AD/Azure AD users or groups to a built-in security group](../organizations/security/add-ad-aad-built-in-security-groups.md).

      - question: Can I add or rename a portfolio backlog?  
        answer: | 
          **Yes**. You can add up to a total of five portfolio backlogs. And, you can rename a portfolio backlog and add custom work item types to a portfolio backlog.  

          To learn how, see [Customize your backlogs or boards (Inheritance process)](../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-backlogs-boards.md) or [Add a portfolio backlog level (On-premises XML process)](../reference/add-portfolio-backlogs.md).


      - question: Can sub hubs within Azure Boards be disabled? 
        answer: | 
          **No**. While you can disable an entire service, you can't disable individual pages within a service. To learn more, see [Turn a service on or off](../organizations/settings/set-services.md). 

      - question: Can I upload my own custom work item type icons?  
        answer: | 
          **Example request**: *When I create a new work item type, I get an option to choose an icon. The icon set is limited and doesn't support the icons that we would prefer for our use case. Is there a way to associate custom icon to new work item type?*   
          **No**. Uploading your custom icons isn't a supported feature at this time.
