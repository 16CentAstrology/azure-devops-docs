summary: | 
  Find answers to frequently asked questions when using Azure Boards. For FAQs specific to Microsoft Excel integration to add or modify work items defined in Azure DevOps, see [FAQs: Work in Excel connected to Azure Boards](backlogs/office/faqs.md). 

  You can view a list of features that are on our roadmap for Azure Boards from the [Features Timeline](/azure/devops/release-notes/features-timeline). 

  To request a feature or up-vote a feature, go to our [Developer Community page](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/spaces/21/visual-studio-team-services.html?type=idea).
 
sections:
  - name: Access and permissions | 
      As a member of an Azure Boards project, you can use the majority of features to track work. Limitations to select features are based on the access level and security group to which a user is assigned. To learn more, see [Default permissions and access for Azure Boards](get-started/permissions-access-boards.md).

    questions: 
      - question: How can non-contributors view or modify work items?  
        answer: |
          ::: moniker range="azure-devops"
          For private projects, you can grant access to an unlimited number of users by assigning them Stakeholder access. For public projects, anonymous users&mdash;ones who don't sign into the project&mdash;can view all work items. To learn more, see [About access levels](../organizations/security/access-levels.md) and [About public projects](../organizations/public/about-public-projects.md).   
          Also, if your organization uses Azure Active Directory to manage user access, you can [add external users to your organization](../organizations/accounts/add-external-user.md).

          You can grant access to an unlimited number of users by assigning them Stakeholder access. To learn more, see [About access levels](../organizations/security/access-levels.md).

      - question: How can I restrict viewing or modifying select work items?  
        answer: |
          You can restrict access by setting permissions for an area path. To learn more, see the following articles: 
          - [Set work tracking and plan permissions](../organizations/security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md?toc=/azure/devops/boards/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/boards/breadcrumb/toc.json)
          - [Grant or restrict permissions to select tasks](../organizations/security/restrict-access.md?toc=/azure/devops/boards/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/boards/breadcrumb/toc.json) 

      - question: What client tools support work tracking with Azure Boards? 
        answer: |
          See [Tools and clients that connect to Azure DevOps](../user-guide/tools.md).

  - name: Work items and templates |
      For an introduction to work items, see [About work items](work-items/about-work-items.md). To define work item templates to specify defaults for select fields, see [Use templates to add and update work items](backlogs/work-item-template.md).

    questions: 

      - question: Can a work item be assigned to several users or a user group? 

        answer: |
          No. Work items can only be assigned to a single user. Also, that user must have been [added to a project or team](../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md).  

      - question: What's the recommended method to group work? 

        answer: |
          The main method to group work is to assign it to the same area path. Area paths are used to group work items by product, feature, or business areas and to support teams responsible for work assigned to those areas. In addition, you can group work under a parent work item using parent-child links, referred to as a hierarchical grouping. 

          For a discussion of these two usages and the tools they support, see [Configuration and customization of Azure Boards, Area paths, product teams, and portfolio management](configure-customize.md#area-path).

      - question: How to mark a task or work item as a milestone task?

        answer: |
          Milestone markers aren't used in Azure Boards work tracking, except for Delivery Plans. Delivery Plans provide a calendar view and allow you to define a milestone marker. For more information, see [Review team Delivery Plans](../plans/review-team-plans.md).  

          However, you can use one or more of the following options to mark a work item as a milestone: 
          - Simply prepend or append the word **Milestone** in the title of your work item
          - [Add a work item tag](../queries/add-tags-to-work-items.md) labeled **Milestone**   
          - [Add a custom field](../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-field.md) labeled **Milestone** and populate it with a pick list of milestones  
          - [Link work items](../backlogs/add-link.md) using the Predecessor/Successor or Related link type to a milestone work item 
          - [Assign the milestone work item to the sprint](../sprints/assign-work-sprint.md) in which it's targeted for completion.

      - question: How can I best track dependencies?
        answer: |
          You can track dependencies between work items by linking them using a related or other link type. See [Link work items](backlogs/add-link.md) and [Linking, traceability, and managing dependencies](queries/link-work-items-support-traceability.md). 

          ::: moniker range="azure-devops"
          You can view dependencies using [Delivery Plans (Preview)](plans/review-team-plans.md). Or, use the [Epic Roadmap](extensions/epic-roadmap.md). 
          ::: moniker-end

          If you are tracking dependencies across one or more organizations, you may want to use the [Dependency Tracker](extensions/dependency-tracker.md).

      - question: Can I copy a work item including its subtasks? 

        answer: |
          ::: moniker range="azure-devops"
          Yes. Azure Boards (cloud service) now supports copying child work items when copying a work item. For details, see [Copy or clone work items](backlogs/copy-clone-work-items.md#copy-clone).  
          ::: moniker-end
          ::: moniker range="< azure-devops"
          **No**. Cloning doesn't copy work item subtasks for on-premises deployments. Is this feature on the roadmap? **Yes**. In fact, it has been released on Azure Boards (cloud service).  
          ::: moniker-end

      - question: Can I create a work item template that creates links to other work items?   

        answer: |  
          **Example request**: *When creating a template, I would like the Parent User Story to be defaulted. There is not a pre-determined field in the template. Would/could this be under a user-defined selection?*  

          No, there is no native support for creating hierarchy templates. In particular, you can't specify a default parent work item. However, you may find a solution To creating child work items by installing one of the following Marketplace extensions:  
          - [Work item form one click actions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mohitbagra.witoneclickactions)  
          - [1-Click Child-Links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ruifig.vsts-work-item-one-click-child-links)  
          - [1-Click Tasks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ruifig.vsts-work-item-one-click-tasks) 

      - question: How do I copy or clone a work item with all linked items? 

        answer: |  
          ::: moniker range="azure-devops"
          With Azure Boards (cloud service), you can choose to copy child work items when copying a work item. For details, see [Copy or clone work items](../backlogs/copy-clone-work-items.md#copy-clone).  
          ::: moniker-end

          ::: moniker range="< azure-devops"
          This feature isn't supported at this time for on-premises deployments. Copying a work item doesn't copy any parent-child linked work items. However, is is now available on Azure Boards (cloud service).  

          The easiest way to accomplish the task of copying many work items with child items, is to create parent-child links to new work items using Excel. To learn how, see [Bulk add or modify work items with Excel, Add a hierarchy of linked work items](../backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md#import-work-items-tree-list).

          Other solutions include employing one of the following Marketplace extensions:  
          - [Work item form one click actions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mohitbagra.witoneclickactions)  
          - [1-Click Child-Links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ruifig.vsts-work-item-one-click-child-links)  
          - [1-Click Tasks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ruifig.vsts-work-item-one-click-tasks)
