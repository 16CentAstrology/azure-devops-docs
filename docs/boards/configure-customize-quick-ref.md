# Configuration and customization of Azure Boards 

[!INCLUDE [temp](_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

This article provides guidance and links to all items that you can customize that impact work tracking tools. 


You configure resources either for yourself, your team, a project, or your organization from an administrative **Settings** page. The settings you can configure depend on the security group or administrative role you belong to. 

If you're just getting started as a Project Administrator, see [Get started as an administrator](../user-guide/project-admin-tutorial.md).

## What to consider?

When configuring or customizing work tracking tools, you'll want to consider the tools your teams use and how they will use them. Whether your teams follow Scrum, Kanban, or some combination of Scrumban. The main configurations that impact on most tools are described next.  


## Area paths, product teams, and delivery plans 

Area paths are used to group work items by product, feature, or business areas and to support teams responsible for work assigned to those areas. You can define a hierarchical set of area paths or a flat set. Typically, you define a hierarchical set of area paths when you want to support a business hierarchy that wants to track progress of several teams.  


## Iteration paths, sprints, releases, and versioning

Iteration paths support Scrum and Scrumban processes where work is assigned to a set time period. 

To use the following tools, teams must subscribe to iteration paths and set sprint dates. 

- Sprint backlogs
- Taskboard
- Delivery plans
- Feature timeline 

And other timeline or calendar view tools. 

## Work item types and portfolio backlog levels 

Each project comes with a set hierarchy of work item types that support a product backlog and portfolio backlogs. The defaults for each supported process is shown in the following tabs. 

[!INCLUDE [hierarchy-work-item-types](includes/hierarchy-work-item-types.md)]


### Basic tools 




### Portfolio planning 

## Analytics 


## Who can make changes? 

You can delegate several tasks to a user with Stakeholder or Basic access by adding them to the [Project Collection Administrators group](..//organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md). To learn more about Stakeholder access, see [About access levels, Stakeholder access](../organizations/security/access-levels.md#stakeholder-access). 


You configure resources either for yourself, your team, a project, or your project collection from a **Settings** page. The settings you can configure depend on the security group or administrative role you belong to.
