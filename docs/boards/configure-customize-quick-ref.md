# Configuration and customization of Azure Boards 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

You configure resources either for yourself, your team, a project, or your organization from an administrative **Settings** page. The settings you can configure depend on the security group or administrative role you belong to. 

If you're just getting started as a Project Administrator, see [Get started as an administrator](../../user-guide/project-admin-tutorial.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can delegate several tasks to a user with Stakeholder or Basic access by adding them to the [Project Collection Administrators group](../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md). To learn more about Stakeholder access, see [About access levels, Stakeholder access](../security/access-levels.md#stakeholder-access).
