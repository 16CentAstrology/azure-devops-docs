## Work items and work item templates

### Q: Can a work item be assigned to several users or a user group? 

**A:** No. Work items can only be assigned to a single user. 

**Q:** Is this feature on the roadmap? No, this isn't on the roadmap. 

### Q: Can I copy a work item including its subtasks? 

**A:** No. Cloning doesn't copy work item subtasks.

### Q: Can I create a work item template that creates links to other work items? 

**Example request**: *When creating a template I would like the Parent User Story to be defaulted. There is not a pre-determined field in the template. Would/could this be under a user defined selection?*

**A:** No, there is no native support for creating hierarchy templates.  In particular, you can't specify a default parent work item. However, you may find a solution To creating child work items by installing one of the following Marketplace extensions:  
- [Work item form one click actions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mohitbagra.witoneclickactions)  
- [1-Click Child-Links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ruifig.vsts-work-item-one-click-child-links)  
- [1-Click Tasks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ruifig.vsts-work-item-one-click-tasks)

**A:** No. This is not customizable.

### Q: Can sub hubs within the Azure Boards hub be disabled? 

**A:** No. Individual pages cannot be disabled. 

### Q: Can I upload my own custom work item type icons?  

**Example request**: *When I create a new work item type I get an option to choose an icon, this icon set is limited and does not support the icons that we would prefer for our use case. Is there a way to associate custom icon to new work item type?* 

**A:** No. This is not a supported feature at this time.
