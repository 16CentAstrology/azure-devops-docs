# Automate work item state transitions

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Automatically update the state of a work item according to the state of its child tasks. For example, if one task is changed to `Doing`, then the user story gets set to `Doing`. And if all tasks are in `Closed` state, then the user story gets `Closed`.

Rules are established at the team backlog level and are applicable to all work items at that specific level. This means that your features backlog can have distinct rules from the user stories backlog.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Work item automation rules exclusively pertain to your teamâ€™s workflow on the backlog and boards. Other teams within your project can customize their own rules to align with their specific work processes.

## Prerequisites

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

* To configure work item automation rules for your team, you must be added to the Team Administrator role or be a member of the **Project Administrators** security group. To get added, see [Add a team administrator](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md) or [Change project-level permissions](../../organizations/security/change-project-level-permissions.md).

* To configure team settings, you must be added to the Team Administrator role or be a member of the **Project Administrators** security group. To get added, see [Add a team administrator](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md) or [Change project-level permissions](../../organizations/security/change-project-level-permissions.md).

## Set rules

Establish these rules independently for each backlog level, including user stories, features, and epics. This way you can automate the closing of user stories, but leave features and epics untouched, for example. Do the following steps to set team rules for work item automation. 

> [!NOTE]
> Work items must belong to the same team; closing a task in a different team or project doesn't trigger the closure of the parent item.

1. Sign in to your project (```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}/{yourproject}```).

2. Select **Boards** > **Backlogs** > :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/gear_icon.png" border="false"::: **Configure team settings**.

3. Check the applicable box(es), which will trigger only the parent work items on this backlog level, and then select **Save**.

   Work item states are set to automatically transition when child items get updated on your backlog.



See the following example of the rules being applied to the user stories backlog level.

Example of rules be applied to several backlog levels in sync.

These rules operate seamlessly, regardless of where you make updates to the child items, such as on the sprint board, for instance.

## Limitations

- Instead of states, we utilize State Categories due to the intricate nature of various work item types and their state models. Categories provide consistency across types making it easier to understand and configure.
- The automation rules default to the first state within the assigned category.
- Updates via REST APIs will not activate automation rules. You can automate the updating of parent items by implementing additional patch updates.
