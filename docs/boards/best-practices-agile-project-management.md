# Best practices for Agile project management 

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

As a project manager new to Azure Boards, use the guidance provided in this article to get started. 

Project Planning 


## Team sizing, team settings  

Azure Boards provides teams the tools to plan and track work. Each project defines a default team, which you can start using immediately. However, if you have a number of development or feature teams, you should consider defining a team in Azure DevOps for each feature team. Consider the following guidance:  

- Define teams 

1. General guidance: 6 to 9 team members - devs, test, PM 

2. Each team gets their own set of tools  - can focus on their set of work with less noise 

3. Program team can view Dev/Feature teams work and manage the Features and Epics 


## Understand which work items you'll use

## Your product plan and your Product Backlog  

The main tool for planning your product is your team's Product Backlog. Use your Product Backlog to perform the following tasks: 

- Define the user stories or requirements that specify the work to be performed. Define user stories sized to be completed within a single sprint. Each user story you add to the backlog is automatically assigned the default area path and iteration path set for your team. 
- Resequence or reorder the user stories so that they are listed in priority order.
- Add details to each user story to capture the work to be delivered. 

	
## Plan a sprint  

Each sprint, perform the following tasks: 

1. Use your Product Backlog to capture the work to do and deliver - sized to be completed within a single sprint  
2. Each sprint: Review your backlog priority, put work in priority order  
3. Each sprint: Map unmapped work to the Larger Features and Epics  
4. Use Story Points to estimate the size of work and to gage Team Velocity   
5. Dependency Management: Link work items to work  items using Predecessor/Successor link types  


## Portfolio Backlog: Features & Epics 

1. Use to capture larger initiatives - Features to Ship,  Epics or larger Scenarios to deliver to customers 

2. Size Features to be delivered within a few sprints, Size Epics to be delivered Quarterly or to some Milestone objective 
	
## During Sprint: 

Kanban Board: Use to talk to status, blocks/issues/risks/changes, update status; Filter to Current sprint, Assigned To 

Taskboard: 
	
## Milestone planning  

1. Product Backlog: Use Forecast to determine what can be completed within the next 3 sprints (Requires Story Points)  

## Review of deliverables and dependencies

1. Use Delivery Plans to review a Calendar view of what's being delivered across teams 
	
## Monitor porgress, process improvement  

Team Velocity:  Use to improve planning/estimating and forecasting 

## Guidance on tag usage  

Work item tags are a useful tool to support queries and filtering of backlogs, boards, and queries. For tags to be useful to the team, provide some general guidance on how your team should use tags. Consider documenting this guidance in a central place, such as the project wiki. 
 
- Have a policy in place about how your teams want to use tags
- Consider how tags will be used for queries, filtering, reporting 
- Cross-team dependency
- Cross-project dependency


Cross-org dependency
