## Best practices for Agile project management 

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]


Project Planning 


## Team sizing, team additions  

1. General guidance: 6 to 9 team members - devs, test, PM 

2. Each team gets their own set of tools  - can focus on their set of work with less noise 

3. Program team can view Dev/Feature teams work and manage the Features and Epics 
	
## Project/Product Planning - Product Backlog

1. Use your Product Backlog to capture the work to do and deliver - sized to be completed within a single sprint 

2. Each sprint: Review your backlog priority, put work in priority order 

3. Each sprint: Map unmapped work to the Larger Features and Epics 

4. Use Story Points to estimate the size of work and to gage Team Velocity 

5. Dependency Management: Link work items to work  items using Predecessor/Successor link types 
	
## Portfolio Backlog: Features & Epics 

1. Use to capture larger initiatives - Features to Ship,  Epics or larger Scenarios to deliver to customers 

2. Size Features to be delivered within a few sprints, Size Epics to be delivered Quarterly or to some Milestone objective 
	
## During Sprint: 

Kanban Board: Use to talk to status, blocks/issues/risks/changes, update status; Filter to Current sprint, Assigned To 

Taskboard: 
	
## Milestone planning  

1. Product Backlog: Use Forecast to determine what can be completed within the next 3 sprints (Requires Story Points)  

## Review of deliverables and dependencies

1. Use Delivery Plans to review a Calendar view of what's being delivered across teams 
	
## Monitoring and Process Improvement 

Team Velocity:  Use to improve planning/estimating and forecasting 

## Guidance on tag usage  
	• Have a policy in place about how your teams want to use tags
	• Consider how tags will be used for queries, filtering, reporting 
	• Cross-team dependency
	• Cross-project dependency


Cross-org dependency
