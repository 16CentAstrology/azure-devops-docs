## Query filters

To determine available query filters, query the metadata as described in [Explore the Analytics OData metadata](../extend-analytics/analytics-metadata.md). You can filter your queries using any of the **Property Names** listed under an **EntityType**. 

For example, 

 and access to the [OData feed](../../extend-analytics/quick-ref.md) of the Analytics Service are in Preview. The sample queries provided in this article are valid only against Azure DevOps Services and depend on [**v3.0-preview**](../../extend-analytics/odata-api-version.md) or later version. We encourage you to use these queries and provide us feedback.
