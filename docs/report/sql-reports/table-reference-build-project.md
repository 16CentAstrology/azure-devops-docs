# Build Project tables 

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-2020](../../includes/version-lt-eq-2020.md)]

 Use FactBuildProjects and the associated dimensions to query for data. Find out about the files and projects that were built and information about those files. Records contain the static analysis and compiler warnings and errors for each file that was built. If it was built for more than one platform or flavor, you can find records for each platform and flavor.  
 
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Build tables are only applicable for XAML builds, which are deprecated for TFS 2018 and later versions. If your build process isn't based on XAML builds, these tables and the TFS Warehouse for builds won't yield any meaningful data.  
 
For information about the measures and dimensions that are associated with these tables in the SQL Server Analysis Services cube, see [Builds](perspective-build-analyze-report-build-details-coverage.md).
