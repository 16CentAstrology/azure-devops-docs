# Work Item Test Result tables
[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-2020](../../includes/version-lt-eq-2020.md)]

You can query for data about work items that are linked to test results by using FactWorkItemTestResult and the associated dimension tables. For information about the measures and dimensions that are associated with these tables in the SQL Server Analysis Services cube, see [Test results](perspective-test-analyze-report-test-results.md).
