# Buy Visual Studio App Center resources  

Partners in the CSP program can enable their customers to purchase [App Center resources](http://www.visualstudio.com/app-center/), 
including build pipelines, test device concurrencies, and advanced push notifications, using a CSP-based Azure subscription.   

To enable the customer to purchase App Center resources using a CSP-based Azure subscription, the customer needs to have: 

 * Co-owner role permissions to the CSP-based Azure subscription
